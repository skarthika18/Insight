12/27/2017,Debt collection,I do not know,Communication tactics,"You told them to stop contacting you, but they keep trying","On XX/XX/XXXX Tower loan called my work number. I called them back the same day and spoke with XXXX, I told her not to call my work again. Then on XX/XX/XXXX I received another phone call at work. I called and spoke with XXXX and stated again not to call my work. Then on XX/XX/XXXX I got another call at work, so I called again and told them not to call my work. On that day I also told them not to call my family members. Then on XX/XX/XXXX I got another call at work. At that point I did not call because, the company was going to call no matter if I asked them not to. They have called and left messages multiple times a day since XX/XX/XXXX on my cellphone, including calling from other cell phones daily. On XX/XX/XXXX XXXX the XXXX at Tower Loan came to my house asking for me. My daughter told him I was unavailable and he left a note on a torn piece of paper with his name and phone number on it. In addition to leaving my daughter a note a placed another note in my car door handle that was printed from Tower loan letter head. Anyone walking past my car could have gotten the letter. I called Tower loan on XX/XX/XXXX to speak to XXXX to let him know he would be arrested for trespassing if he came on my property again. XXXX told me not to threaten him and that he would do what he needed to and that he was going to sue me. I told him that the constant phone calls daily needed to stop. He was told again not to call my work, to which he replied, I have an authorization form right here so that takes care of that, I can call when and where I want to. I told him I had lodged a complaint with the Attorney General 's office as well. I told him that they needed to stop calling with cell phones daily as well. XXXX denied cellphone calling and stated that it may be other creditor 's trying to reach me. XXXX told me that it would be really hard for me to pay my electric bill once he garnished my wages. He also said that if a payment was not made by the XXXX that he would file a right to cure. He told me that I better hope I get my income tax refund sometime in XXXX as they would file a right to cure. He told me several times that he was going to sue me and raised his voice to the point of yelling at me. I told XXXX that I had made a payment arrangement online to be paid in XXXX so the daily phone calls needed to stop. I told him if he did not have a payment by the XXXX that he could call. He told me he would call me multiple times a day everyday until the XXXX despite having a scheduled payment online. I told him the reason I was not paying was due to having a XXXX child. He told me that he did n't believe me nor did he care. All he cares about is getting his payment and on time. I told XXXX I was telling him this is my cease and desist notification from calling me. I have made a scheduled payment online and that unless they do n't get that payment, the calls need to stop. I also told him I would notify them in writing that the calls need to stop. XXXX told me that they would continue until the account was paid in full. I told XXXX that I would follow up the Attorney General 's office and would consult a personal lawyer if need.",,"TOWER LOAN OF MISSISSIPPI, INC.",MO,65043,,Consent provided,Web,12/27/2017,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,2765189

Nobody can even get one response. This is absurd. Not to mention they did a surprise listing by of a new asset called bitcoin cash, and there was massive volume increase for bitcoin cash on all the other exchanges before the surprise listing. Blatent insider trading. They said they are investigating their employees for insider trading, but that 's does n't help us. For a company making as much money as they are, and with as many customers as they have to not have a customer support system is ridiculous. I am hoping this company is n't a large ponzi scheme, but that is how they are acting. Please help us! There are thousands of ppl waiting for bank wires, and thousands in XXXX waiting for XXXX transfers. There were no warnings on their site until days after I requested the money. The first warning said XXXX business day delay, and now it says XXXX business days delay. It is XXXX days later. I will never use this company again, and i strongly recommend others avoid them too. I am begging you for your help. Many ppl have said they have frozen their crypto transfers as well. Something very fishy is going on.

When attempting to get a refinance or modification they game another excuse. I had no choice but to file a small claims lawsuit against Bank of America, while in court the Judge was in my favor in poor practice however the reason the Judge dismissed my case without prejudice.

It states that is a collection for XXXX. On XXXX XXXX, it reports a completely different company with the same account number and address as on XXXX. On XXXX, is shows the full account.

I am making the account payment of {$140.00} to full fill my financial responsibility to Citibank. Also I am writing a letter directly to the Citibank to express further concern. 

To resolve this matter I am requesting that Citibank remove the negative rating that they originally sent to the three credit bureaus even if they have to delete the line of credit. The way it reads currently is extremely unfair and punitive because I became ill unexpectedly.

The reason I know that you did not verify the alleged debt because the same companies you reached out to ; XXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX could not verify with XXXX  that this debt was indeed verifiable, so both companies were DELETED. Section 609 states that following : 609. Disclosures to consumers [ 15 U.S.C. 1681g ] ( a ) Information on file ; sources ; report recipients. Every consumer reporting agency shall, upon request, and subject to 610 ( a ) ( 1 ) [ 1681h ], clearly and accurately disclose to the Consumer : ( 1 ) All information in the consumer 's file at the time of the request except that -- ( A ) if the consumer to whom the file relates requests that the first 5 digits of the social security number ( or similar identification number ) of the consumer not be included in the disclosure and the consumer reporting agency has received appropriate proof of the identity of the requester, the consumer reporting agency shall so truncate such number in such disclosure ; and ( B ) nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to require a consumer reporting agency to disclose to a consumer any information concerning credit scores or any other risk scores or predictors relating to the consumer. 

( 2 ) The sources of the information ; except that the sources of information acquired solely for use in preparing an investigative consumer report and actually use for no other purpose need not be disclosed : Provided, That in the event an action is brought under this title, such sources shall be available to the plaintiff under appropriate discovery procedures in the court in which the action is brought.

( 3 ) ( A ) Identification of each person ( including each end-user identified under section 607 ( e ) ( 1 ) [ 1681e ] ) that procured a consumer report ( i ) for employment purposes, during the 2-year period preceding the date on which the request is made ; or ( ii ) for any other purpose, during the 1-year period preceding the date on which the request is made.

( B ) An identification of a person under subparagraph ( A ) shall include ( i ) the name of the person or, if applicable, the trade name ( written in full ) under which such person conducts business ; and ( ii ) upon request of the consumer, the address and telephone number of the person.

If you are denying me as a consumer the information that Section 609 states you are required BY LAW to provide to me once requested, I then have the right to sue Experian.

Just in case Experian has forgotten Section ( 609 ) of the Fair Credit Reporting Act is a Consumers Disclosure Section which is to provide for the protection of consumers against false and erroneous reporting.

This section of the FCRA places the burden upon the Credit Bureaus and the creditor to prove an account is yours.

To positively prove an account is yours, the creditor must provide the Credit Bureau a copy of the original creditors documentation ( whatever you filled out and signed upon opening the account with the reporting creditor ).

The FCRA was enacted by Congress to protect consumers from unverifiable accounts and information from being reported on your credit report. Without documentation, the Credit Bureaus have NO RIGHT to list your personal financial information on your credit report.

The Credit Bureaus are required by law to verify and validate every single account on a consumers credit report.

I would like to have all of this information and if you can not provide this information to me, then you must delete this information. XXXX has done their due diligence and deleted both of these accounts for which I dispute. Simply because, the information can not be verified legally. How is it that XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX will verify with you, but will not verify the accounts as accurate with XXXX 

XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX Acct # XXXX and XXXX XXXX Acct # XXXX have not been verified as accurate. 
Also another error that Experian has allowed, is once I provided documented proof that this accounts were not accurate, Experian allowed XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX to increase the allege debt from {$410.00} to {$1200.00}. PLEASE PROVIDE DOCUMENTATION THAT THERE IS A CONTRACT SHOWING I WAS EVER LOANED THAT {$1200.00}. I KNOW THAT CONTRACT DOES NOT EXIST HOWEVER EXPERIAN IS ALLOWING FALSE REPORTING FOR PROFIT. This is my last and final attempt. I will sue Experian for false reporting and I will win simply because of Experians failure to accurately verify and report. I have attached yet another document of proof that these items are not accurate and must be removed from my credit report. I have attached a copy of my XXXX report showing that both XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX Acct # XXXX and XXXX XXXX Acct # XXXX have both been deleted.

I also informed her that I have letter from XXXX stating that due to my XXXX status that the debt was not being actively collected by XXXX. She stated that she would need to get my information to pull a credit report that she think I would still qualify based on the information I had provide. She pulled my credit report and gather the information to proceed with pre-qualification process. She sent the information to the mortgage company XXXX XXXX XXXX, to be screened for preapproval. A couple of days later she contacted me to request supporting documents such as the letter from XXXX along ID and bank statements to process the pre approval. My realtor scanned the documents and forwarded them to XXXX XXXX.

After this I was forward the loan application and contract information the e-sign and some information to scan back to her office. One of the documents that was in contract package was a form asking for credit card information on for appraisal fee, I contacted her office and asked why I needed to supply my credit card in formation because she initially told me that it was apart of closing. She told me that I did n't have to supply that information. So I left it blank and scanned and emailed the package back to her. A couple days after she received the documents she contacted me and stated that she did need my credit card information, I ask why? she stated its for in case you decide after we have the house appraised that you no-longer want to purchase the home then we will have to bill you for the appraisal.

I went to XXXX XXXX XXXX  because I wanted to work with a reputable and very responsive mortgage officer. I left my previous mortgage officer who failed to walk me through the process and respond to my emails and calls within 24-48 hours. I am smart enough to research info on the internet. But my situation was unique. I am XXXX XXXX with no XXXX income. So I had specific needs and wanted to work with a lender who specialized in working with people like me. My previous mortgage officer freely gave me a copy of my credit report with the credit score showing. In the past, I have received this same type of report from other lenders. I shared this credit report with XXXX XXXX and his supervisor ( XXXX ) at XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX, FL ). He said he could use this report to get a good idea of my situation. The report was only 3 - 4 months old. So my situation or credit score had not changed much. It had actually improved. I thought XXXX could use the current report without pulling another report ( which would show as an inquiry on my credit report ) in order to issue me a basic pre-qualification letter. I provided the income and taxes he requested. 
I told XXXX that I wanted my credit report. Clearly, I wanted it if I GAVE him my current report with SCORE that was provided to me by my previous mortgage rep. 
I was disappointed to learn that he would not give it to me. There are many inconsistencies in the mortgage industry. Some mortgage officers have given it to me for free. Others say that by law they are allowed to have me pay a fee to receive my full credit report with the score BEFORE the closing. I asked XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX at XXXX XXXX XXXX ) and XXXX if I would get a FULL credit report WITH the SCORE at the closing. Neither one of them responded. If I can get this full report at closing, then why ca n't they give it to me NOW. I could have paid a fee for this. I did not even know my credit was being pulled AGAIN! Now that they pulled it, of course I want to SEE IT! After the back and forth and countless phone calls and all of my wasted time, this has caused me NOT to trust XXXX XXXX XXXX. I do n't believe they will disclose everything to you in advance. You will be blind sided by information. I can not risk having another unresponsive mortgage rep. I learned from other mortgage people that XXXX XXXX XXXX is required to give me a consumer report which is my full credit report WITHOUT the XXXX XXXX.

How can you trust a mortgage company who acts like this? See attached text messages I had with XXXX and XXXX. This situation NEVER had to escalate to this point.

In late XX/XX/XXXX ( around XX/XX/XXXX ), my husband was XXXX to XXXX. This XXXX happened very quickly and unexpectedly, and it occurred while my husband was in the middle of a permanent change of station ( PCS ) move. My husband used his government issued Citibank credit card to cover the costs of his PCS move. 

In late XX/XX/XXXX, after I reviewed my husbands statements, I discovered that he was double charged for a move-related expense. A merchant charged us twice for the same bill : first on our debit card and the second charge was to his government-issued Citibank card. I was not sure how to respond since the card was under my husbands name and was the responsibility of/tied to my husbands unit in the XXXX ( his unit is based out of XXXX XXXX XXXX ). At the time, and even as of this writing, my husband and his unit were inaccessible because they were deployed and in special training.

In late XX/XX/XXXX, I made a payment in the amount of {$140.00}, which was the true balance that was outstanding ( i.e. the payment did not include fees ). I thought it would be best to pay the principal amount even though it was in dispute and file a dispute when my husband returns from his XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I sent a certified letter to Citibank indicating to them that : 1 ) my husband was XXXX and that under the SCRA they shouldnt be charging fees or interest while hes XXXX ; 2 ) the amount citibank used as a basis for exorbitant fees was being disputed. Unfortunately, Citibank proceeded to garnish my husbands wages. 

My husband has spent hours trying to resolve this matter, however, because he is XXXX, he has limited access to resources who can help. Additionally, this has added unnecessary stress on my husband.

The door on the ATM that disburses cash continuously opened and closed, but never gave me the {$100.00}. I tried to contact the number listed on the ATM, but due to the XXXX holiday nobody answered the phone. 
On XX/XX/XXXX I noticed that {$100.00} was deducted from my account for the XX/XX/XXXX attempted transaction, so I drove to the XXXX XXXX XXXX  branch of Bank of America in XXXX. I informed the young man ( I did not get his name ) what transpired with the ATM and the fact that I never received any money. He informed me that the branch is unable to resolve a dispute with the ATM and that I should call the number listed on my receipt. 
About 10 minutes later I contacted the number listed ( XXXX ) on my receipt and waited approximately 15 minutes before an automated voice asked if I wanted to have someone call me back, and I replied yes. Around 30 minutes later I received a call from someone, but I missed the call. They left a message to call back at XXXX. I was unable to get connected at this number. 
At XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX I received a call from a representative of Bank of America and I explained what happened. She said I need to talk to a different department, so she transferred me. After approximately 10 minutes, the person who answered the phone stated that she was not the correct person to talk to about my situation, but I should talk to the ATM grievance or dispute department. I told her about the problem and how I had been transferred multiple times and nobody was helping me to get to the correct department. She said that she would make sure I would be transferred to the correct group. I waited and waited and waited on the phone, but nobody answered. After about 20 minutes of listening to music and the same voice message stating that they had high volume of calls, the phone went silent, but I was still connected.

In XX/XX/XXXX, we decided to move our insurance policies away from XXXX XXXX  to another provider because we have had significant premium increases on our homeowner 's insurance since XX/XX/XXXX. When XXXX XXXX started sending premium refunds all of the refund checks were from JPMorgan Chase. On XX/XX/XXXX, Chase disbursed {$1000.00} from our mortgage escrow account as an overage and then raised our mortgage payment to {$1200.00} without any prior notice. On XX/XX/XXXX, we paid our XX/XX/XXXX mortgage payment of {$1200.00}. The entire amount was applied as a principal reduction payment. When we received the escrow disbursement check we voided it and sent it back by certified mail to Chase. Chase deposited the {$1000.00} back into our mortgage escrow account on XX/XX/XXXX by special escrow deposit. On XX/XX/XXXX, Chase disbursed {$1000.00} from our escrow account again without prior notice. Chase made a special escrow deposit on XX/XX/XXXX without our knowledge. We received the disbursement check on XX/XX/XXXX. We voided the check and kept it. In XX/XX/XXXX, Chase disbursed again for a third time from our mortgage escrow account {$1000.00}.

In XX/XX/XXXX, we received a premium renewal notice from XXXX XXXX in the amount of {$3400.00} which was a significant increase from {$2300.00} for the prior year.

I distinctively remember that they touted salaries of {$100000.00} for starting graduates. The very first year, the student loan amount was small, but every year the loan amount required to pay for the year nearly doubled. The student loans show this progressive allocation of increased costs per year. 

Fast forward after graduation, my Private Student loan payment was nearly {$1500.00} a month. My initial bi-weekly net pay with my {$36000.00} year job was approximately {$1100.00}.

Approximately almost two years ago I saw something pop up on my credit report from Stuart Lippman and I contacted them to show me proof of what I could possibly owe them. I am very diligent when it comes to my credit, so I was shocked to see a blemish on my report. Stuart has not been able to come up with ANY information showing that I owe them anything.

They have no proof of anything owed in my name and refuse to stop the collection process. This company robo dials me all hours of the day and has been harassing me nonstop. 



After pain staking work, I was able to get the account off my credit via each of the 3 bureaus and I thought all this was behind me. However, recently I saw that they changed the account number and double the amount they are collecting and have put it back on all 3 bureaus without my knowledge or consent. Needless to say, I hit the roof as you could imagine as this slimy no good collection agency should be shut down for ruining peoples lives when they have no proof and are operating above the law.

( B ) Requirements relating to the reinsertion of previously deleted material ( ii ) Notice to consumer if any information has been deleted from a consumers file pursuant to subparagraph ( A ) is reinserted in the file, the consumer reporting agency shall notify the consumer of the reinsertion in writing no later than 5 business days after the reinsertion or if authorized by the consumer for that purpose, by any other means available to the agency. I received no such notifications and they have no proof to show notification. This is a HUGE VIOLATION of the FCRA and I reserve the right to pursue legal action for their blatant and outright disregard for the law.

I was led to believe that the entry door had 2 KEY LOCKS and instead it has only 1 top key lock and a deadbolt. I have been calling and emailing XXXX XXXX Corporate Office, Home Depot Installation Manager and Home Depot Sales since XXXX XXXX, XXXX to get this matter resolved and no one seems to value my time, safety or the urgency of this issue. As a result, I will not pay the outstanding balance of the Entry Door - {$2600.00}. 
As stated in the Home Depot Credit Card Purchase Agreement, my repayment shall commence following the COMPLETION of ( all ) the Project ( s ). Hence, the Entry Door Project has not been completed. There is also the matter with the scratched Bay Windows, but I can only manage one long outstanding issue at a time. I will address the Bay Windows issue by the next statement due date. 
Please refer to chronology of events that have occurred since Monday, XXXX XXXX, XXXX : 1. Installation Date of Entry Door : Friday XXXX XXXX, XXXX { I questioned the installer about the missing key lock and he told me to contact HD on Monday } 2.  Initial call to Home Depot Customer Support ( XXXX XXXX Shamya Winfield ) : Monday, XXXX XXXX, XXXX { several complaints were filed on this day : installer took my garden broom, Bay Windows were scratch during the installation ; debris was left on my living room floor following the Bay Window installation, AND the Entry Door was not the correct door }. 
3. XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I informed the Installation Managers Assistance ( XXXX XXXX ) that it was imperative to have this Project Completed before the start of the school year because I would only be available on Sundays between XXXX and XXXX. I was assured that the door would be installed by XXXX XXXX, XXXX. 
4. Made official compliant with HD Corporate Office : XXXX XXXX, XXXX 5. XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I asked the Installation Manager and Sales Manager to defer payments on the Entry Door until the Project was completed. As of the date of this communication, neither Manager has followed up with me on  this request. I also inquired about the difference in price for the new door since its obviously cheaper given the downgrade. I was told there was no difference. I still disagree and will follow this up. 
6. Several additional calls made to Installation Manager, HD Corporate Office : XXXX XXXX thru XXXX XXXX 7. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXXales Manager, came by my home to have me complete a new order form to order a door with 2 KEY LOCKS.

8. Date to re-install correct door was scheduled for Saturday, XXXX XXXX, XXXX. Installations showed up 5-hours past the scheduled time with the incorrect door. In fact, it was the same exact door that was already installed. I called the Installation Manager,  XXXX XXXX at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX the same day and he informed me that since it was the weekend there was nothing he could do. No empathy. I asked him to follow-up with an email or text to inform me of the next steps to get this resolved. I never received an email. In fact, I ended up leaving voice mail messages every other day for the next 2 weeks.

9. On XXXX XXXX, XXXX, the Installation Manager, XXXX XXXX contacted me via text to ask what type of door did I order. I informed him a door with 2 KEY Locks. Subsequent effort to finally warp this up and have the correct door installed has not occurred. 
10. Please refer to email messages : As you can see from my account, more than the minimum payment is being made on time. I have gone out of my way to reach out to the Regional Manager, HD Complaint Division, even the CEOanyone that could help resolve this matter, but to no avail. 
Lastly, please apply all past payments to the higher priced transaction, Bay Windows {$4900.00}.

For reasons that they are unable to fully explain, and seems as though they do not want to take any blame on their part, they made a payment to my insurance company that did not go through.

I confirmed I was never contacted regarding an authorization and they repeatedly told me that had I authorized this, it would have been paid. They refused to confirm why I was not contacted. When I asked that they immediately release the funds they confirmed that their insurance department was closed and they could not confirm if I had enough funds. When I told the manager I had access to my online account and asked if that was the same amount he told me he did not have that information and refused to put me on hold to confirm with another representative. It was n't until I told him that I would personally file a complaint against him if he did n't even attempt that he put me on hold and within 2 minutes was able to confirm the amount was the same.

We have been contacting SPS for several years requesting assistance options in an effort to sell our "" underwater '' home. We were continuously told that our "" loan holder had a note on our account stating that we were not eligible for any form of loan assistance. '' We asked multiple representatives on multiple occasions who the loan holder was and why we were being prohibited from mortgage assistance? We were repeatedly told, "" I do n't have access to that information. '' In XX/XX/XXXX, we contacted SPS again requesting assistance and were told that with the changes in the HUD laws, we were eligible for several loan modification options. One option was a modification and the other option was a short pay. We were advised to open requests for BOTH the modification and the short pay so we could save money through the modification while we waited to see if we were approved for a short pay. We submitted all the required documentation for both the loan modification and the short pay. We received notification of a new mortgage amount reflecting a loan modification and that we were starting the "" trial period '' for the modification in XX/XX/XXXX. We asked, How has the mortgage been modified? Was the interest rate lowered, or was the principal amount reduced? Will there be a balloon payment at the end of the mortgage? We were told, Im not a modification specialist. I dont have the terms of the modification in front of me. I cant tell you that. In XX/XX/XXXX ( the final month of the trial period for the modification ), we received a letter notifying us that our request to terminate our loan modification was received and the modification was cancelled. We immediately contacted SPS to find out why this was done because we had, at no time, requested to cancel our request for a modification. We were then told, "" You ca n't have a request for a modification and a short pay open at the same time. '' We asked why we were advised to open both requests at the same time and why the SPS representative opened both requests on the phone if we were not permitted to do so? We were simply informed, "" I do n't know. She never should have told you could do that. Clearly you do n't understand how this works. '' As of XX/XX/XXXX, we  continued to work with SPS on the short pay request. We repeatedly asked several questions regarding the terms of a short pay : "" What happens to the remaining balance of the loan? Does a short pay negatively affect your credit score? Will we be held financially responsible for the difference of the old and new mortgage amount? Will we owe taxes on the remaining balance of the previous mortgage? '' Each time we were told, "" I ca n't tell you that. I 'm not a loan assistance specialist. I 'm not a financial advisor. I ca n't answer that. I 'm not a credit specialist. I ca n't answer that. '' We asked to receive documentation of all of the terms and conditions and stipulations of the short pay and each time have been told, "" We ca n't give you that. We do n't have any documentation. '' Over the course of eight months ( since we initially opened the short pay request ), we were repeatedly contacted by SPS and told that we needed to provide documents to move forward in our request. Each time, we sent the same documents several times ( documents were sent within 24-48 hours of each request ). We would call and follow-up to make sure that the documents were received. We were always given the same response, "" I see they have been uploaded to the site, but I ca n't see the documents. They will be reviewed and someone will get back to you in 3-5 business days. '' Week after week, month after month, we would receive phone calls requesting further documentation. Despite our constant attempts to clarify with SPS, they would call asking for proof of transactions for bank accounts we did n't hold, last two months pay stubs from my place of employment ( they were told repeatedly I have n't worked in over 3 years and do not have pay stubs ), and would re-start the application process over every time they requested something within 10 days of our previous correspondence. 
We also began to receive repeated phone calls from realtors informing us that our mortgage company was requesting BPO inspections and that they had to come to the house to take pictures and provide appraisals. We had a total of six realtors come to our home as of XX/XX/XXXX. We contacted SPS multiple times requesting information as to why an excessive number of BPO inspections were being requested. We finally received some validation from a representative from SPS ( XXXX ) who said, "" I have never seen this many BPO 's requested. Why was a drive-by inspected requested? We do n't even allow those. You should have only needed two of these and I see that you have more than enough. '' We were told that when you submit an offer to the loan holder to submit the lowest possible offer, and then the loan holder would go back and forth with offers until we eventually agree on a final amount. However, upon submitting our second short pay offer in XX/XX/XXXX, we received notification that SPS completely closed our application for a short pay because our offer was denied. After months of stress, exhaustion, submitting documentation, phone calls, BPO inspections, home repairs, etc., we were right back to "" square one '' with no explanation as to why? We called SPS and asked why our request was closed and explained that we were told we could continue to submit offers until the loan holder agreed on an amount. We were told, "" No, that 's not how this works. You only get one counter offer and then we close the request. '' We explained that if we were told that in the first place we would have come in higher with our initial offer. We received nothing more than a, "" Sorry, but that 's how it works and there 's nothing we can do. '' We were then told that if we wanted to continue with the short pay process, we would have to start the application process completely from scratch, submit all the documentation again, and this time, we were responsible for getting our own XXXX because the mortgage company would no longer send realtors on their behalf to conduct the inspections. We complied and resubmitted all required documentation AND a BPO from XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. Shortly after, my husband received a phone call AGAIN requesting my most recent pay stubs. ONCE AGAIN, my husband explained that I have not worked in over 3 years and that there were no stubs to provide. The next contact we received was that SPS required us to provide a HUD statement showing proof of funds for the short pay. We asked how we could possibly request a mortgage without knowing how much to request and if we are approved for a short pay? They said, "" That 's how this works. You need to show where the money is coming from. '' Once again, we said, "" We are willing to comply with your requirements, but you 're still not telling us how much we need to request from a mortgage company. We need an amount to apply for. '' We were told, "" I 'm not a loan assistance specialist. I ca n't tell you that. '' As of XX/XX/XXXX, we asked again what the terms, conditions, and stipulations of the short pay were, how it would affect our credit, what the financial liabilities were, etc. Once again, we were denied answers. 
To date, we have no resolution or assistance from SPS regarding any form of mortgage assistance. SPS refuses to disclose any information to us regarding our request for a short pay. Each time we speak to someone, we receive different information and no one will commit to assist and/or advocate for us in any way. We have been assigned a relationship manager but have only spoken with him several times throughout the process ( despite our repeated requests to receive calls from him ). As it stands, we have been told that we are required to obtain a mortgage for an unknown amount and show proof of funds to SPS for an ambiguous short pay.

Our family has struggled and suffered tremendously throughout this process and our plans to move into a new home have been repeatedly delayed as a result of SPSs negligence. We fear that we have been ill advised and are being pressured into a very dangerous financial commitment that may significantly and negatively impact our family. We are desperately seeking assistance in this matter and would greatly appreciate any support in rectifying these issues and/or pursuing legal action again Select Portfolio Servicing.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,"SELECT PORTFOLIO SERVICING, INC.",NY,10916,,Consent provided,Web,12/29/2017,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,2766411

I received a document that I never seen before with my "" forged '' signature which appeared to be signed by XXXX XXXX ( Finance Manager ) whom I completed my paperwork with on XX/XX/XXXX. I received the lease vehicle and copy of my contract on XX/XX/XXXX. This newly created contract has a purchase date of XX/XX/XXXX which is indeed incorrect. I NEVER returned to complete any additional paperwork and the signature on the contracted date XX/XX/XXXX Is certainly not mines ( This can be compared to the original documents with "" my '' personal signature ). 
Further more I brought this to the attention of the General Manager XXXX XXXX whom I had a conversation with. He tried to steer me away by advising me to file complaint against the x employee ( XXXX XXXX ) However I reminded XXXX XXXX that the employee represented the company ( Nissan ) at the time and technically because this is a forged contract should be viewed as a VOIDED contract. XXXX XXXX states he would call me back on XX/XX/XXXX with some possible solutions. To date I have received no return call. I have also reached out on numerous occasion after the forth only to be hung up on by XXXX XXXX ( General Sal Manager ) whom I have also spoken with regarding this matter. My calls are currently being ignored. This is poor & unprofessional business behavior. In addition to calling I have even gone to the location only to be told the managers are in a meeting. 
I have since recently filed a complaint with the Attorney Generals office regarding this matter. This has been very stressful to deal with and has caused a negative impact on my health. I do not intend to or will ever purchase another Nissan vehicle. ( This is my 3rd ) and quite frankly I have had poor experiences each time with them all.

After attempting a second time, I discussed the issue with a co-worker and we both agreed that the payment system must be glitching ( again ). As such, I dialed the customer service number and proceeded to make the payment over the phone.

On or around XX/XX/XXXX I noticed on my personal account that JP Morgan had erroneously accepted two of the payments and withdrawn the corresponding balances from my personal account without permission. Although I authorized the bank to retrieve funds from my account, I would never have authorized a double posting under these conditions. 

Soon after identifying this issue, I contacted JP Morgan and got the proverbial "" run around '' until they finally pledged to refund the erroneous second payment. The representative indicated that the reimbursement would be issued through a check and that ACH was not an option, despite having used ACH to obtain the funds. 

As of XX/XX/XXXX I have still not received my refund and yet the payment within JP Morgan 's system has been reversed. This essentially means that I am floating JP Morgan about {$360.00} of my own personal funds due to their system processing errors. When I called the customer service representative for an explanation, the representative ( XXXX ) indicated that this is JP Morgan 's procedure for handling refunds. Rather than waiting for a successful reimbursement to clear, the staff actually reverses the payment in anticipation for the refund to clear. If payment is not received, XXXX said to call back and they will work on it again. 

I am disappointed with this entire process and urge you to look into a reasonable remedy.",,JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.,MI,49837,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,12/29/2017,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,2767034

I was made the executor and administrator of my fathers estate by the State of California. All I am asking for is the title to my fathers vehicle, any over payments and to put this situation behind me. Please help CFPB. 
I have been my fathers legal XXXX and in charge of his finances since XXXX of XXXX til his XXXX in XXXX XXXX. Because of the seriousness of his illnesses I helped my father set up automatic payment plans for all his financial obligations which included Santander Consumer USA. Due to my fathers declining condition I spoke with XXXX XXXX on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX from Santander and have a paper trail that my fathers financial obligation to them was fulfilled on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX as per the agreement XXXX XXXX from Santander Consumer emailed me. 
Since my fathers XXXX every call to Santander has been a multitude of excuses on why they can not send me the title. They either have to talk with someone who never happens to be there or another dept to get approval and return my call which never happens. Depending on who answers my call from Santander they also use the excuse of not being able to talk with me about the account. They have had my Power of attorney paperwork on file and have communicated with me for years prior to my fathers XXXX. I had to give up out of frustration, grief and life. 
So last week, I decided to give another attempt on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX hoping. I spoke with XXXX XXXX, he said that he would be able to help me with the title if I sent him the proper information that day. I reminded him that they should have a copy of my Power of Attorney on file. I emailed him my fathers XXXX certificate and XXXX from Probate Court showing I am the administrator of my father estate. On my return call he said the individual was not in the office to approve the release of the title and that another dept would need to approve the XXXX. He said that I would need to wait 48hrs before calling back. 
On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX 48hrs later I spoke with XXXX XXXX and he said that he could not release the title because there was a balanced owed. I could not believe what he was saying. I asked if he could send me a statement, he said that he could only give it to me verbally over the phone! I questioned how a bank could want to collect from an account without a statement and only verbally give it to me information over the phone. He asked if I had any Santander statements from my fathers account and I told him NO to see what he would do. 
He emailed me a balance of {$8000.00} dated XXXX/XXXX/XXXX as if my father did not pay a dime of {$6000.00} from the original agreement. At the time I spoke with XXXX XXXX on this Settlement Agreement Offer. He agreed to give us the title after the payments were made. I do not understand how rationally they think they can keep receiving payments on a car purchased 12 years ago. XXXX XXXX thought I was completely in the dark and would be able extort my money from my family. This company is a step below street mobsters and loan sharks. 
Please CFPB let me know if you will need any other information, I didnt want to attach 4yrs of statement but if you need them let me know.

12/29/2017,Debt collection,Medical debt,Written notification about debt,Didn't receive enough information to verify debt,"This is the issue, then I will explain in specifics. I required ambulance service XX/XX/XXXX. I was admitted to the Emergency Room at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX, Pa. XXXX. I had subsequent tests, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, the following week. My point in telling you this, is all those hospital bills and testing bills were paid in full by my insurance XXXX. I have all the personal identification numbers, etc, if this is something you require later. I never received an ambulance bill from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, Pa. XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX ext XXXX "" XXXX ''. Yesterday, XX/XX/XXXX, a debt collection agency contacted me. Commercial Acceptance Company at XXXX. XXXX has been very helpful, polite, professional with my case. Tells me I have a delinquent bill of {$2000.00}. I ask what the billing is for, my credit score is  XXXX, I pay my bills, I 'm a XXXX XXXX and I worked hard to establish credit. The bill is from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX for the XX/XX/XXXX service. XXXX at Commercial Acceptance gave me all the information so I could start making phone calls.If this is not rectified by XX/XX/XXXX, it damages my credit report as a bad debt. She also put a hold on the accruing interest. The Ambulance bill is {$1400.00}. The collection fee is {$370.00} with the interest to date of {$130.00} for a total of {$510.00} in fees. That will not increase, as I the interest has stopped. First thing I do is call my insurance, XXXX XXXX. Always nice, always helpful. They never received the bill either from XXXX XXXX. Every other bill from the hospital was paid in a normal timely fashion. If I had seen a bill, I would have addressed it, if my insurance had received it, they would have paid the bill. Next I called the XXXX XXXX XXXX. I spoke to XXXX. The address, phone numbers, and insurance company for billing for me were all incorrect. This is where this issue starts. I asked where they got that information, upon delivering me to the emergency room they go to the hospital information desk, and take the my previous patient information. I have not been to that hospital since I was born, which was 22 years ago. I politely asked why they do n't verify that information, XXXX XXXX answer was "" the ambulance ca n't stay, it 's how we do it, and it happens all the time ''. At that point I gave her all the correct insurance information, along with correct contact information. I understand the ambulance ca n't stay, and if this happens often, my thinking is you need a new system, which I did not say, she was polite, and going to "" check into it ''. I also asked if I should call XXXX XXXX which is where they incorrectly sent the ambulance bill. XXXX was adamant, no. I thought that was odd. The next day, since this has me very concerned, XX/XX/XXXX, I started calling to double check things were corrected, and we were working towards resolving this. I called the collection agency, Commercial Acceptance first. Yesterday I gave them my correct insurance information, I wanted to confirm they indeed contacted XXXX XXXX, XXXX confirmed it was done. I called my insurance company XXXX XXXX to update them. I then called XXXX XXXX to double check if they had the information and were submitting the billing for services rendered on XX/XX/XXXX.  I asked XXXX to repeat something, as I was taking notes. This seemed to upset her, and she asked why I was taking notes. I told her I am just trying to keep all the case facts correct to try to rectify this issue. I told her I did contact the incorrect insurance company XXXX XXXX XXXX they billed and I have the denial of service explanation of benefits, dated XX/XX/XXXX, addressed to them, which XXXX states she never received. She also stated she never received any "" undeliverable, not known, unable to forward '' returned bills sent to the incorrect address with my name. She also stated she did not have contact with the collection agency yesterday, when they did indeed confirm contact. At this point, she just became irate and belligerent. Loudly explained to me, "" it has only been 1 day, I have n't had the chance to speak to my office manager, these things take time ''. Well, they took the time to have a collection agency call me? I am working very hard to not have this effect my credit score, when all of this is not my fault, I remained polite, asked to speak to the office manager, I was told she was on another line. I said I would wait, XXXX stated it was going to be a long wait. I asked if the office manage would call me back, XXXX said yes, and terminated the call. I called back to ask if she wanted my phone number. I was on the phone with my insurance company when the office manager called back, she left an equally belligerent message. I called her back, unprofessional, rude, and condescending.And, I could not get her to give me her name. Now. The only thing I am trying to do here, is pay a bill that I, and my insurance company never saw. I guarantee, if either of us had received the bill, it would have been paid. If I have a bill, it gets paid, end of story .I do not want my credit score damaged which is what they are threatening me with for the extra {$510.00} in fees. This ambulance company, who acknowledged to making the mistakes, is in no hurry to make this right. I honestly do not feel the {$510.00} in fees they are adding on for collection services and interest should not be my responsibility or burden as I am a XXXX XXXX. I just want to pay my bill of {$1400.00} for services rendered and move on.

12/29/2017,Checking or savings account,Savings account,Managing an account,Banking errors,"On XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I opened a XXXX XXXX account from XXXX XXXX  through a promotion they offered. The promotion indicated that depositing {$15000.00} or {$20000.00} by XXXX/XXXX/XXXX would earn a bonus payment from XXXX in the amount of {$150.00} or {$200.00}, based upon the amount deposited into the account. Despite having met the requirements of the promotion ( my balance in the account was {$15000.00} on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX ), they refused to provide me with the bonus for {$150.00}. 

Prior to XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, I did not have a XXXX XXXX account and therefore had {$0.00} on deposit with their bank. Then on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, I had {$15000.00} on deposit with them in my savings account. In between those dates ( XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and XXXX/XXXX/XXXX ), I made a variety of deposits and had interest deposited into the account by XXXX until the balance reached the {$15000.00} on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX ( see amounts and dates below ). This pattern of activity satisfied the terms of the promotion to earn the {$150.00} bonus payment but not the {$200.00} payment. However, XXXX XXXX claims I did not meet the terms of the promotion at all. 

I contacted XXXX XXXX on or about XXXX/XXXX/XXXX to inquire when I saw that the {$150.00} bonus still had not been paid out to me ( the promotion stated that the bonus would be paid by XXXX/XXXX/XXXX ). At that time, I was told the issue would be investigated, which could take up to two weeks. On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, I received a letter ( dated XXXX/XXXX/XXXX ) from XXXX XXXX stating that I "" did not meet all of the promotional criteria. '' However, the letter did not specify what criterion or criteria I did not meet. Thus, I called XXXX XXXX customer service again on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX to get more information and request my bonus payment. The numerous representatives with whom I spoke all stated that the "" marketing department '' reviewed my complaint and that I was not eligible for the bonus payment and that nobody would be able to help me. 

Finally, on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, I spoke with a third person who claimed that he would further escalate my issue. I was told that I would get a response by early XXXX XXXX ( within 10 business days ). All of the representatives I spoke with that day claimed that the deposit of interest into the account did not count toward the {$15000.00} in deposits required for the promotion. It should be noted that the fine print of the promotion did NOT stipulate that deposits of interest did not count toward meeting the requirements. Also, I had transferred a total of {$14000.00} into the account ( just {$2.00} shy of {$15000.00} ) and the amount of interest that XXXX said did not count was only {$2.00}. The only reason I did not transfer more into the account from my other bank was the fact that I was in fact transferring enough to meet the {$15000.00} deposit requirement. Why would I aritrarily deposit even more? Had I known that the deposit of interest would not count, I easily could have deposited {$2.00} more from my other bank. Here is the history which demonstrates that {$15000.00} or more was deposited into the account by XXXX/XXXX/XXXX : Acct History : XXXX/XXXX/XXXX - Account Opened Balance - {$0.00} XXXX/XXXX/XXXX - DEPOSIT - {$100.00} Balance - {$100.00} XXXX/XXXX/XXXX - DEPOSIT - {$3000.00} Balance - {$3100.00} XXXX/XXXX/XXXX - DEPOSIT - {$2400.00} Balance - {$5500.00} XXXX/XXXX/XXXX - INTEREST PAID - {$2.00} Balance - {$5500.00} XXXX/XXXX/XXXX - DEPOSIT - {$5000.00} Balance - {$10000.00} XXXX/XXXX/XXXX - DEPOSIT - {$4400.00} Balance - {$15000.00} I find the promotional language to unclear at best and misleading at worst. In fact, I met the terms of the promotion as written ; however, XXXX XXXX claims that their terms are actually different than what was written in the promo language ( i.e., that interest does not count ). The terms did not specify that interest did not count, and I find this "" change '' in terms to be an attempt by the XXXX XXXX to change the terms after the fact so that they do not have to fulfill their obligations to their customers.

12/29/2017,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Deposits and withdrawals,"On XX/XX/XXXX, someone who was pretending to be my husband went to a Chase branch in Indiana and filled out a withdrawal slip for {$4200.00} and received that amount of money out of our checking account. On the same day at the same IN location, a cashier 's check made out to someone we 've never met in the amount of {$2500.00} was taken out of our same Chase checking account. In the first withdrawal slip, my husband 's first name was misspelled. In the withdrawal slip for the cashier 's check, the account number was incorrect ( one of the numbers was wrong ). We live and work in Illinois and have never done any banking or have never lived in Indiana. These 2 transactions depleted our account by almost 1/3 of the amount. On XX/XX/XXXX, at a different Indiana Chase branch, a cash withdrawal for {$860.00} was filled out and received from our aforementioned checking account. The same day, at the same location, a {$2600.00} cashier 's check was written to someone we have never met from the same account and again my husband 's first name was spelled incorrectly. On each of the withdrawal slips, the last 4 digits of our account are written in much  smaller print than the other digits of our account, which should have been a red flag to the teller that this could be identity theft. This is in addition to the 2 incorrect spellings of my husband 's first name and the incorrect account number on one slip. We discovered the XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX withdrawals on XX/XX/XXXX and alerted Chase fraud. A freeze was put on our account and we reopened a new checking account the following day. We discovered the errors on the night of XX/XX/XXXX when we were reviewing our accounts and on XX/XX/XXXX we filed a police report. My husband is a XXXX and was on shift on XX/XX/XXXX so he was unable to file a police report on XX/XX/XXXX as he works 24 hour shifts. When I went to the Chase branch on XX/XX/XXXX to open a new account and explain everything that had happened, the personal banker I was dealing with was more interested in trying to get me to become a Chase Private Client because she found out that our savings account is n't with Chase and that we use a financial advisor ( outside of Chase ). A branch manager was not notified of  our issues or if he or she was, that person never came to me to find out more information about our situation. On XX/XX/XXXX when my husband was off his shift and after he had filled out a police report, he also went to the same Chase branch and dealt with the same woman who again was more interested in convincing him to become a Chase Private Client than in helping us. After all of this, we received a letter from Chase that was dated XX/XX/XXXX stating that Chase had researched the transaction ( s ) we reported and denied our claim, stating that the time frame to request reimbursement passed. A single letter telling us that {$10000.00} of our hard earned money will not be returned to us. Chase could n't even bother to call us and explain their decision. Thanks to the negligent tellers in 2 different Chase branches, my husband was the victim of identity theft. My husband has been a client of Chase since it was XXXX XXXX.  We have our checking account through Chase. We have a savings account for each of our children with Chase. We have a Chase credit card and never carry a balance. Our mortgage is with Chase. Each year, the interest on our mortgage that Chase earns is more than XXXX the entire amount that was taken from us and we have never been late on a mortgage payment. After my husband received the letter, he called Chase claims to protest the claim denial and was assigned someone to his case. After the case was reopened and again reviewed, we got a letter from Chase Customer Claims Department dated XX/XX/XXXX stating that after they researched the transaction, they deemed the XX/XX/XXXX transactions were unauthorized and credited our account {$6700.00}. When we called to inquire as to why our full amount was n't credited, we were informed that the Fraud department of Chase felt that because of our negligence to report the XX/XX/XXXX transactions, the XX/XX/XXXX occurred. There is no way that Chase can prove that my husband would n't have been the victim of identify theft if we would have discovered the XX/XX/XXXX transactions sooner. The XX/XX/XXXX transactions occurred at a different Indiana Chase branch and the cashier 's check was made out to a different individual. Shortly after we received the XX/XX/XXXX letter we received a letter informing us that we had "" insufficient funds '' in our account to cover a check that we had written on XX/XX/XXXX. This check happened to be cashed after our identify theft issue  was discovered and our account had been changed. When I went to Chase to get a letter stating that my husband was the victim of identity theft in order to show that we did in fact have "" sufficient funds '', I explained our story to a different Chase private banker. Again, no manager was informed or came to speak with us. At the end of our conversation, I stated that we were considering litigation given the circumstances. After I had gotten home that afternoon I received a called from the Chase branch stating that the manager had been informed and the complaint was being escalated to Chase Branch Escalation Services. I am sure that if I had not mentioned litigation, this wouId n't have been taken to Branch Escalation Services. I have since been assigned a case reviewer from the Branch Escalation Services Department. I have had multiple conversations with her and was last told, a few weeks ago, that the case is again being reviewed but we may not hear a final decision for up to 90 days. We are a middle class family. If we lived paycheck to paycheck, we would be in serious trouble without this money. Each person I have talked to at the Chase branch has told me you have 60 days to report a dispute on your statement. The statement for our XX/XX/XXXX transactions came out on XX/XX/XXXX. We reported both the XX/XX/XXXX and the XX/XX/XXXX issues on XX/XX/XXXX. Both of these are within the 60 day reporting window from the original statement date. Identity theft alone is a nightmare. It creates hours of phone calls and paperwork. As a consumer, you want your money to be kept safe at a bank. You also want to feel that the bank is looking out for the consumer. As Chase clients, my husband and I feel that our money was not kept safe and that Chase does n't care about the consumer. Instead, Chase is interested in managing more of the consumer 's money while still not caring about the consumer himself. 
Of note, I have not attached any copies of the withdrawal slips or our checking account statements as this website said not to submit personal information.

12/29/2017,Student loan,Private student loan,Struggling to repay your loan,Problem lowering your monthly payments,"Back in XXXX, I attempted to make my first payment to Sallie Mae, it was almost {$600.00} on top of my other student loan payment of over {$600.00} to XXXX. I tried to figure out a way to pay both sets of student loan bills on top of my other bills ( car, gas, insurance, etc. ) I was able to consolidate my XXXX payments but Sallie Mae told me they could not help me. They told me my only options were forbearance, delinquency, or bankruptcy. I asked if there was any way they could lower my payments and again, my only options were forbearance, delinquency, or bankruptcy. I chose forbearance until I could figure out a solution. My forbearance ran from XXXX through XXXX, which I was required to pay $ XXXX loan as a good faith payment for a total of {$150.00}. I was instructed to call back at the end of XXXX to extend my forbearance. I was limited to one year and I could extend in 1, 2 or 3 month increments. I called back on Thursday, XXXX XXXX and the representative asked me why I was filing for forbearance. I simply replied that I could not afford the payment. She asked me a series of questions and I told her that my income, as a XXXX XXXX XXXX could not support me enough to be able to pay the {$600.00} / month. She gave me attitude and asked me if I looked into a 3rd party income driven repayment plan. So I went and looked into it. On Friday, XXXX XXXX, I applied for it and noticed that it went to my XXXX  loans and not my Sallie Mae. I contacted the federal student aid services, ( that 's who I filed my income driven payment application through ) and they informed me that I needed to contact Sallie Mae and fill out a paper application to send to them or input into their system. So I contacted Sallie Mae and the girl informed me that I needed to contact the Federal Student aid people and see if they could just send over my application or call XXXX and see if they could forward it to Sallie Mae. So I called XXXX and the very nice representative informed me that Sallie Mae is strictly private loans now and my Income driven application would not even be applied to those loans. At this point, I was irate. I called Sallie Mae back and was given the run around. Never once did someone at Sallie Mae tell me that my income driven application would n't be valid for private loans. Over a span of 40 minutes, I talked to customer service representatives who told me my only options were were forbearance, delinquency, or bankruptcy. I asked to speak to a supervisor and again he told me he could n't help me and my only options were forbearance, delinquency, or bankruptcy. The supervisor said he does n't work with collections when it comes to payments and that they could transfer me to collections and see what they could do. They told me to call back the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX of next month to see what they could do for me. I asked to be transferred to collections. Now, at this point, I have explained my situation 6 different times to representatives at Sallie Mae over the course of 2 days. As soon as I told the collections agent, the first thing he said was, this sounds like a customer service issue. I said oh no, they told me it 's a collections issue. So the collections representative from Sallie Mae explained that because I did forbearance for 3 months, I would need to wait till XXXX XXXX to call back, with the stipulation that I do n't make my payment for the month of XXXX so I go into delinquency. I explained over and over and over again that I do n't miss payments and that I did not want this to hurt my credit score. They assured me it would n't hurt my credit score and that the collections reps at Sallie Mae should be able to help me lower my payment. I am trying to be proactive and get ahead of this but Sallie Mae is not making this easy for me. The only reason my father cosigned my loan was because they wanted to give me some outrageous interest rate if I did n't have my father cosign. Even when I applied for the loan, I felt discriminated against because my loan disbursement and interest rate was based off amount of income my parents generated which I do n't think is appropriate since I am the one paying my loan off, not them. I am trying to pay my loan, that is both reasonable and affordable. I am sick of getting the same, ridiculous excuses. They had no problem giving me a loan with interest rates all over the place but now they expect me to pay back loans that I can not afford with my salary. I ca n't even live on my own, I have to live with my parents because my income does not allow me to support myself and pay my student loans.

I also asked that any additional payments I make, in addition to the newly increased minimum payment, be applied to that same loan as well. They said this was n't possible because the loans were consolidated. I asked to speak to someone who could help me and was put on hold for 20 minutes. Finally spoke to someone who reiterated that it was n't possible, then reversed course and said the loan with higher interest was not part of the consolidated loans, and that they could do this for me ( online there is no option for me to apply payments to individual loans, it says they are all consolidated ). I reiterated what I wanted, and they had forgotten to add the stipulation that any additional payments be put toward the loan with the higher interest rate. After being put on hold and waiting 5 min or more again, this was finally resolved as well.

Despite my emails, I am afraid I would not get any response from coinbase support as they have replied to me with an automated response. I am horrified that they may seize my funds, I have already lost a lot of money. 

I provided coinbase support with photos of my driver license and my utility bill to my house in Maryland. I have contacted coinbase support on the day I was locked out and have sent several inquiry emails requesting a follow-up or a status update but still no clue or any sign of them. 

I visited XXXX to see my family and I dont really have any intent on going back. I visited coinbase.com just out of curiosity because of the the recent movement in BTC prices and I was immediately greeted by the above message. 

Please advise what to do and how should I proceed and if there is any way I can get my account reopened.

Wells Fargo Home Mortgage used a routine but, little notice form to sneak through mortgage modifications on unsuspecting homeowners. Our original loan was XXXX dollars and now its XXXX dollars plus escrow is XXXX as well as almost another XXXX to pay off our loan. That 's double the amount of the original loan. They modified the loan years ago and they did it to benefit from adding more years to the payoff time to get extra interest income generated by longer home loans. They asked us to pay three payments for a permanent loan modification, but that did n't happen.They foreclosed on our home and had a sale date. We had to file a chapter XXXX to save the home because our lender would not give us any options because they, said we owed too much on the loan. They are the reason why we owe this much! the HAMP program is being used by this company and others to collect cash from the government and to eventually foreclose on peoples houses, and make it harder to recover. I need them to explain the hidden fees, and I believe that they have set us up to fail, and that we are worse off than before.

They are not helping people, but making money from the hardships of homeowners. They make {$1500.00} per modified mortgages that eventually ends up in bankruptcy. We are in bankruptcy now, but the payoff is not correct. They are not using the HAMP money in the right way.. Wells Fargo Home Mortgage is ripping home owners off, and the people who regulate them are not doing a good job of protecting the homeowners. We bailed the big banks out, but who is bailing us out! They are getting rich off the backs of poor and middle class people. Why do we have to fill out stacks of paper exposing our privacy, but the banks hold back everything that they do n't want the public to know. If we just ask the government to help us to help ourselves, its a handout! That was our tax dollars that we work for. When will we get our American dream?

I never received them. I called American Express gift card services on XX/XX/XXXX to check the status of my order and was told by XXXX, the customer service rep, that the cards were showing delivered to my front door at approximately XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. I informed XXXX that we had not received the gift cards and asked what my options were. XXXX put me on hold to check the status of the cards. When he got back on the line, XXXX informed me that all of the 24 gift cards had been used and that he was going to open a fraud investigation to look into a resolution. He told me to "" not worry '' and that I would have a resolution within 7-10 business days. I asked him if I should submit a credit card dispute to which XXXX said no and suggested we wait until we hear back from the investigation team. We waited. 
I then called American Express gift card services on XX/XX/XXXX to check status and was told that this was still being investigated and that I would "" for sure '' hear from someone the following week. I did not receive any updates. I then called gift card services on XX/XX/XXXX to check status and was told that the investigation was still showing open and was being worked on. I was also told that there no updated notes and that there was no one in the investigation dept that we can request status from. I asked to then speak with a supervisor who told me the same thing and said that my only option was to wait. At that time I submitted a credit card dispute to American Express for the {$700.00} charge since I was not getting any resolution or option for replacement cards from the gift card dept. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from XXXX credit card services stating that the {$700.00} charge was being credited to me while the dispute investigation took place. 
There were no updates from either dept until XX/XX/XXXX when I received a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX from the credit card dept stating that they were able to confirm with "" the merchant '' ( which was their American Express gift card dept ) that the cards were delivered so that the charge of {$700.00} was valid and being placed back onto my account. I was appalled that the two departments were not talking and that the credit card team was not aware that the gift cards had been stolen and that it was under investigation. I then got on the phone on XX/XX/XXXX and called the gift card dept asking for all the merchant information of the 24 cards that were used so that I was able to call the merchants individually and submit fraud disputes with them. I want to be able to show American Express that these charges that were completed were not by me and that these cards were in fact stolen from my front porch. I was able to pin down the merchants, the charge amounts and the times of the transactions which is able to show that these were not charges that neither my husband or myself completed ... proving as my claim has said that these cards were stolen from my front porch. I have been able to open fraud investigations with two of the merchants where the thieves shopped the most & on the same day the gift cards were delivered ( XX/XX/XXXX ), XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX as well as XXXX XXXX in XXXX. They will both be disputing the charges with American Express directly and also will be able to identify who signed for the transaction. At this point, I am disappointed that there has been no resolution and it has been over a month since we ordered the gift cards. I have been more than patient, called to follow up several times and even completed by own investigation to show that these items were clearly stolen. I would hope that this does not happen to another consumer and that XXXX",,AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY,CA,92620,,Consent provided,Web,12/30/2017,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,N/A,2768594

I lost, and have now replaced, a 2 factor authentication device ( my old phone ). I previously complained to the CFPB about this. Coinbase replied in a way that indicated that they had not even read any aspect of the complaint at all. They have taken zero real steps towards resolving the issue. 

The response they sent to me after the CFPB forwarded my initial complaint was an auto-message identical to the first one they sent to me. This indicates that no one had even read my emails to them. 

I really need a solution to this now as my assets are depreciating and they are denying me access to my funds and are misrepresenting the situation to both BBB and CFPB by saying that I will be contacted by an agent. I have received absolutely zero assistance from coinbase other than additional auto-messages ( many of which are repeats ) which do not resolve my issue. A human agent is needed to solve it. 

I have created a new account as instructed several months ago before they stopped replying the first time. Now the site claims my id is invalid. This was not the case when I used the same id to send them money. It must have become invalid now that I want to withdraw it seems. 

I feel at this point they are sending me in circles and have read none of my messages. No genuine attempt whatsoever has been made to restore my account access despite months of trying.

1/1/2018,"Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan",Personal line of credit,Charged fees or interest you didn't expect,,"I obtained a line of credit from Paypal in the beginning of XXXX to make a singular, particular purchase. Paypal offers a promotion for obtaining credit, "" Paypal Credit ''. Right on the webpage, they have this statement : "" When you need to buy something, you dont want to wait. With PayPal Credit, you can enjoy special financing offers like this one : No Payments + No Interest if paid in full in 6 months on purchases of {$99.00} or more. Buying with the power to pay as you choose and still enjoying the security and reliability of PayPal ... now thats magic Interest will be charged to your account from the posting date ( which is usually within a few days of the purchase date ) if the purchase balance is not paid in full within 6 months. Subject to credit approval. See terms. 

I made the purchase promptly after obtaining the credit, which the application process had its own disappointing issues. When the statement was made available a few weeks later, I was expecting the promotion details to be stated on the statement. There were no details about my promotion, my charge was listed as a "" Standard Purchase ''. It was not clear at first why no details of my promotion were not listed and it wasnt clear to me what a standard purchase was supposed to mean. But on the surface, things seemed ok because this was not a cash advance, it was not a balance transfer, it was an ordinary consumer purchase to a vendor that was conducted online. Inspecting the statement carefully, the fine-print on the back of the statement had language about promotions and deferred interest saying : "" There is one type of Deferred Interest Purchase : No Payments + No interest if paid in full in 6 months Purchases : Deferred Interest Purchases on which no payments will be due during the six-month deferred interest period. 
If you pay the balance on a Deferred Interest Purchase in full by the Expiration Date, we will not charge any interest for that Purchase. We will calculate the interest for each Billing Cycle prior to the Expiration Date and disclose it on the billing statement as the Accrued Deferred Interest. If you do not pay the balance in full before the Expiration Date, ( 1 ) we may charge your Account, in the Billing Cycle in which the Expiration Date occurs, interest on that Promotional Purchase from the transaction posting date at an APR of 19.99 %, and ( 2 ) any remaining balance will be treated as a Standard Purchase beginning on the Expiration Date. '' There was also language for a "" Standard Purchases '' on the back of the statement, it stated : "" You can make a Standard Purchase using this Account by choosing the PayPal Credit Payment System when you make a purchase from a Merchant at a website, by telephone, or at another authorized location. We will extend credit to you, in the amount of the Cost of the Purchase, by paying the Merchant on your behalf. '' So it did not clarify that my purchase would not be interest-deferred and I had no reason to expect that the interest would not be deferred provided I paid the balance in 6 months. 

So I contacted PayPal and they told me that the promotion does NOT apply to my purchase and it was incumbent on me to determine beforehand if this was a "" qualifying purchase '' by contacting the vendor. What was clear from the beginning was the statement, With PayPal Credit, you can enjoy special financing offers like this one : No Payments + No Interest if paid in full in 6 months on purchases of {$99.00} or more. What was NOT clear was that purchases are not all considered equal. It was also not clear to me that *I* had to contact the vendor before making the purchase to see if their purchase would apply under another partys financing promotion and terms. That would mean having to contact a third party to find out if the sale of their merchandise qualifies with the bank ( Paypals financing terms ) as a promotional-eligible purchase before even bothering to go through the entire application process for obtaining Paypays credit. But this is also under the assumption that some random vendor would know intimately Paypals policies and processes for extending credit and exactly how their promotions work. That would also be like two complete strangers have agreed to extend credit/financing from one to the other and the second is paying me their money, and I am completely privy to the terms of their lending. Does Paypal not realize that most people are neither mind-readers nor prophetic, even over distances?

So I appealed to the logic that their marketing did not state that only certain purchases or a limited pool of vendors would apply for this promotion. I also pointed out that it was not clear that the client needed to do this research beforehand and it was not logical that the third party would necessarily know Paypals promotional policy. The point that their promotion allowed for deferred interest on the contingency of paying the entire balance within six months was the entire purpose of inquiring for their credit and I asked them to extend the promotion to this on the basis of their ambiguity, calling out the marketing as deceptive effectively impossible to discern as they state. We have gone back and forth a couple times and their responses have been part adamant and part unintelligent as they refuse to acknowledge the ambiguity of the language in their marketing and the statement fine-print.",,Alliance Data Card Services,IA,50613,,Consent provided,Web,1/1/2018,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,2768852

The debt on the condo I had financed through XXXX XXXX XXXX was also discharged. 

The condo was occupied by a squatter who lived there from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX when the condo association filed suit against me for unpaid HOA fees as the bank did not foreclosure due to the many foreclosures in Florida at the time. In the meantime, XXXX XXXX XXXX had released their lien and the property was sold to the condo association via certificate of title for the amount due on HOA fees. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX, who apparently bought the loan from XXXX XXXX XXXX began sending mortgage statements and this showed up on my credit report as unpaid, so I wrote them a letter on XX/XX/XXXX and they removed this from my credit report. 

I then began receiving mortgage statements from XXXX XXXX and called them but they said they would need proof of my bankruptcy, which I faxed to them, but the mortgage statements continued to be mailed. 

Then, XXXX XXXX, a division of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX filed a Complaint against me and the condo association in XX/XX/XXXX, along with a Notice of Lis Pendens seeking to foreclose the mortgage. I filed an answer to the complaint stating that this property was discharged in bankruptcy. The case is ongoing in the XXXX Judicial Circuit Court of XXXX County, Florida, and I do not know what to do from here. I am still receiving mortgage statements for the balance due on a monthly basis. 

Just recently when I pulled into my driveway after work, a server stopped me in front of my home and asked if I would consider a deed in lieu of foreclosure on the property to XXXX XXXX and I told her that I do not own that property, that it was released in bankruptcy in XX/XX/XXXX, and the condo association is now the owner of the property.

Several years later, a coworker suggested that I ask about the teacher loan forgiveness program and I did. When I called I asked specifically if this would affect the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program and I was told it would not. I applied for this and it was paid toward my loan. I was told it would reduce the amount of my entire loan and the Public Loan Forgiveness Program would pay less. This {$5000.00} did not benefit me as my entire loan would have been completely forgiven anyway. At this time, I had no information outside of what I was being told. During another call I asked if I needed to complete an application for the Public Service Loan and was told it wasnt necessary until XX/XX/XXXX. I was not told nor sent any information about Public Service Loan Forgiveness to review prior to accepting the Teacher Loan Forgiveness. I found one by chance decided on my own to complete the Employment Certification only after I had completed the XXXX Loan Forgiveness application. This was the first time I had access to any information about Public Service Loan Forgiveness. During this entire process no one mentioned how one impacted the other. 
At some point in time my loan was handed over to XXXX. I have continued to call multiple times each year to make sure I was on track for my loan to be forgiven. I asked specifically in XX/XX/XXXX about my number of payments and was told there was no problem it would be repaid in XX/XX/XXXX. My due diligence was performed when I asked about the teacher loan forgiveness and with each call I have made since XX/XX/XXXX. No one explained that the Teacher Loan Forgiveness would impact the Public Service Loan Forgiveness until I asked about my number of payments in XX/XX/XXXX.

I requested a customer service supervisor from XXXX to call me on my cell phone and I was never contacted. 
If I had access to information regarding how one impacts the other prior to accepting, I would never have agreed to the XXXX Loan Forgiveness. I asked but was not made aware that the years of service and the number of payments would be affected. In short, five years and 60 payments have been taken from me without my knowledge or consent. I asked this about this directly and was told it would not affect the Public Loan Forgiveness at all. Because I can not rely solely on my vision I counted on what I was told to be the truth. I should have 10 years of public school service as of XX/XX/XXXX with 120 faithfully made payments counted toward forgiveness.

After 8 weeks of weekly visits with other members of the bank branch I finally agreed to switch if they would stop coming to my business. They had me sign a document at my business while I was with clients, after I signed I got a machine in the mail and began processing with what I thought was wells fargo.

I had multiple accounts that were open and I had not opened them. I went to the bank branch 5 different times and they told me they could not stop the withdrawals from my account and that the branch manager had been promoted so I could not speak with him.

On my paper bill it said go to Walmart.com/credit. I went to the website and it was very difficult to find the link to make a payment. There was a huge advertisement to get a credit card. The link to make a payment was found located very discretely at the bottom of the page. It was difficult to get to the bottom of the page due to the fact the advertisement to apply for a credit card was so huge, as soon as you click the area in error it brings you to a page to apply for a credit card. After registering, I was able to make a payment. I chose the option to pay with a debit card. After giving my debit card information and clicking submit, it did not confirm my payment was made. It did not give a reference number or any expectations. I go back to research and it does not reflect my payment was made. It will allow you to make another payment despite the fact that you just made a payment. I checked my bank account and the amount was taken from my account. I contacted online customer service and explained what happened. The respond that it will take XXXX hours to reflect a payment was made. My concern is that this website was very misleading and should reflect and confirm when your payment has been made. There was no disclosure of what to expect after making my payment. I want to mention I did contact my bank and customer service first before trying to submit another payment, my concern is for those who would have not thought to do that.

12/30/2017,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose prepaid card,Problem with a purchase or transfer,Card company isn't resolving a dispute about a purchase or transfer,I put XXXX on a XXXX XXXX card because Im repairing my credit after a devorce and bankrupsey. For an entire year I never used the card but I kept reading by not using it I was not getting the full bennifit of having the card. So I started using it and at some point XXXX XXXX just changed things by giving me my money back but then using their money. Ok great every month I transferred money paying off the debt and using the money which was showing I could repay the loan. Well all was fine until I lost my card. I replaced the card but still paid my bills by giving my other bank card to XXXX until my new came. I buy money and Im on a payment plan with these companies. Ok I told them my new card with XXXX XXXX but they did not explaine that their computers would have to update. So I put money on the XXXX XXXX card to cover charges but one creditor used my debt card with XXXX  so XXXX took all the money back charged me {$30.00} and the other creditors had interest charges when the funds werent Their with XXXX XXXX. So Im getting nasty messages not going threw. So I hear from XXXX telling me everything would had been ok except this one merchant charged your card and that threw everything off. I said I asked was the amount correct every time before I move money and XXXX said it showed nothing on hold. Ok I said how can you tell me that and yet a unexpected charge comes threw. Then they say some merchants may take funds latter date and it want show! How if you cant see funds on hold how am Im to know whats on hold? The problem is their is no way according to XXXX. Ok I then sent the new available amount from XXXX to XXXX XXXX which went threw. Then once that was ok I sent {$18.00} over to XXXX XXXX just to clear out an account. Ok I check the next day and the computer tells me its still in my XXXX account instead of being in XXXX XXXX so I call XXXX and ask why did it not transfer? She tells me maybe their was a glitch try it again. So I do well that {$18.00} dollars transferred but so did another {$18.00} which was not in the account so XXXX takes back the {$18.00} and charges me another {$30.00} for not enough funds! Im XXXX XXXX Im a XXXX Veteran I dont have money to throw away! XXXX blamed XXXX XXXX for bein the one not taking the funds nice their release! I call XXXX XXXX asking why they arent posting my funds once released from XXXX? They ofcorse blame XXXX ok I transfer {$100.00} it went threw fast! Then I send {$140.00} and I did that in Fri it did not post until after XXXX with XXXX XXXX almost three days. XXXX XXXX said the computer was on Holiday which is why it took that long! Since when do computers go on vacation? But during the conversation she says the account is closed! Im like how can you close a card I opened wit my money so I can use it as I invest in the card? She said I violated the card rules! Then a manager said wad the contract you signed! I did not sign a contract I applied for a unsecured card I put money on much like a debt card! Well I guess thats not what XXXX XXXX calls it but my payment on the card a month s only {$37.00} Im putting way more than that on the card plus their is a balance of {$240.00} on the card! So why close a card m paying on. Im trying to get every creditor to use that card so not to have charge made to my XXXX card any longer. But XXXX XXXX says I can open another account but the one I have now is closed. I think if your paying the card every month they should not close my card. As far as merchants deciding one day oh I owe them and take funds Im unprepared for and the XXXX banks not removing charged money from my available money sucks but I can only go by what the computer says or what those working at the bank tell me is available?? I think I have One nothing wrong I did my part to pay every month on that card I feel I should had received notice of if these issues kee up my account could be closed but I Never was warned and again their is funds on the card its not deliquient so I feel Ive been wronged y XXXX XXXX XXXX.,,CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION,TX,78744,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,1/2/2018,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,2767787
12/31/2017,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,,"XX/XX/XXXX SENT VIA EMAIL XXXX & U.S. MAIL XXXX XXXX XXXX , XXXX. 
XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, Georgia XXXX SENT VIA EMAIL XXXX & US MAIL XXXX XXXX , XXXX. 
XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, Georgia XXXX NOTICE TO CEASE AND DESIST EFFORTS TO OBTAIN POSSESSION OF XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, GEORGIA XXXX Dear XXXX XXXX & XXXX, This letter is in response to a letter that I expect to and anticipate receiving shortly from your office. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, the same day that I received a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX from your law partner, XXXX XXXX, I sent you a response letter explaining in detail my position with respect to illegal and unethical foreclosure of the subject property referenced above ( see Exhibits A-B ). 

First, as will be explained in greater detail below, the foreclosure auction involving the subject property that occurred on XX/XX/XXXX is void ab initio for a myriad of reasons, based on civil regulatory violations, criminal conflict of interest, criminal complicity, fraud and other criminal conduct. 

LACK OF STANDING Prior to the foreclosure auction on XX/XX/XXXX, I had previously filed at least two ( 2 ) lawsuits against XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX within the past two ( 2 ) years in XXXX County Superior Court ( later removed to Federal District Court ) related to their improper noticing my home for foreclosure ( please take judicial notice ). 

By virtue of XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX having been a named as a Co-Defendant in multiple lawsuits also naming the Servicer ( XXXX ), Trustee ( XXXX ) and Investor ( XXXX   ), XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, as a law firm, had a conflict of interest and therefore had no standing or authority to conduct the foreclosure sale to begin with. 

FIRST ACT AND COUNT OF CIVIL & REGULATORY VIOLATIONS & CRIMINAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST, CRIMINAL COMPLICITY AND CRIMINAL FRAUD In addition to the Mortgage Servicer ( XXXX ), Trustee ( XXXX ) and purported Investor ( XXXX ) having no standing to foreclose on the subject property to begin because of a continued conflict of interest as described above, XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX also did not having standing to foreclose on the subject property as they did not include the name of the true Investor in their notices to myself nor did they disclose such in the required ad they ran in the XXXX XXXX. 

XXXX XXXX, not XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, was and is the actual and true Investor prior to and the time of the foreclosure auction. 

This was confirmed to me by an XXXX employee, XXXX ( last name not provided ) believed to be in the Loss Mitigation Unit at XXXX, Employee ID # XXXX at XXXX XXXX EST on Monday XX/XX/XXXX. 

The concealment of the true investor constitutes an act of fraud in the foreclosure transaction and violates various provisions of Title 44 of the Official Code of Georgia. 

This fact and this fact alone, voids the transaction in its entirety. 
SECOND ACT AND COUNT OF CIVIL & REGULATORY VIOLATIONS & CRIMINAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST, CRIMINAL COMPLICTY AND CRIMINAL FRAUD Second, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX individually and collectively violated numerous provisions of consent orders that they entered into over the past decade with several Federal Agencies, including Consumer Protection Financial Bureau, the Office of Comptroller General, The United States Department of Justice and the Office of Thrift Supervision, well prior to their initiating foreclosure of the subject property. 

In addition, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX violated various rules issued by the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX governing the conditions that must be met before a mortgage company can foreclose, including, but not limited to : 1 ) Demonstrated and Actual Good faith consideration of a homeowners request for loss mitigation options ; 2 ) Full, thorough and good faith consideration of homeowners request for loan modification ; 3 ) Denying a homeowners request for loss mitigation options only if there is a sufficient and articulable basis and reason to do so and ; 4 ) The right of a homeowner to appeal the denial of request for loss mitigation options or loan modification prior to the foreclosure auction. 

XXXX, et al did none of the above and so in addition to XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX  not having standing to foreclose on the subject property because of a conflict of interest, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX, likewise did not have actual or equitable standing to foreclose on the subject property either. 

THIRD ACT AND COUNT OF CIVIL & REGULATORY VIOLATIONS & CRIMINAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST, CRIMINAL COMPLICITY AND CRIMINAL FRAUD On or about XX/XX/XXXX, I received an anonymous letter advising that bid rigging occurred during the foreclosure auction on XX/XX/XXXX. Since your clients, XXXX XXXX, XXXX and XXXX XXXX, XXXX submitted the winning bid, I assume that the bid rigging scheme involved them both. ( see Exhibit C ). 

I notified the XXXX County Clerk of Courts office, the United State Department of Justice and the XXXX County District Attorneys office of this. ( see Exhibits D-E ). 

Assuming that your clients or others engaged in bid rigging during the foreclosure sale, the foreclosure transaction is void from the inception and this is on top of the fraud and conflicts of interest noted above. 

FOURTH ACT AND COUNT OF CIVIL & REGULATORY VIOLATIONS & CRIMINAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST, CRIMINAL COMPLICITY AND CRIMINAL FRAUD Following the removal of the multiple cases I filed against XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX, from XXXX Superior Court to Federal District Court for the XXXX District of Georgia, the cases were assigned to Magistrate Court Judge XXXX XXXX, who unbeknownst to me, was formerly a Partner with the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX who has and still represents XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX and is paid XXXX of dollars each year for doing so. 

Also assigned to the case as the Supervisory Federal Judge, was Judge XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

Rather than Judge XXXX follow standard protocol and recuse herself because of an actual conflict of interest, she chose to remain on the Magistrate Court Judge and proceeded to issue recommendations and rulings adverse to myself and in favor of the Banks, all of which were adopted and mirrored by Judge XXXX final order ( s ) from the Report ( s ) and Recommendations ( s ) from Judge XXXX. 

Suffice it to say, that none of the rulings and orders by Judges XXXX and XXXX are enforceable. On the contrary, as one would expect, all rulings issued by both conflicted Federal Judges are void and unenforceable with Judicial Complaints pending against both for violations of their Judicial Oath and Conduct Prejudicial to the effect and expeditious administration of the courts business. 

Thus, even though these cases in Federal District Court appear to be administratively closed, all are in fact subject to and will in fact be vacated and set aside through Rule 60 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure because of such conflicts of interest on the part of the Federal Magistrate Court Judge, XXXX XXXX, which were imputed to Judge XXXX. 

Your firms continued involvement in this case is not only constitutes obstruction of justice, but is also tantamount not only to perpetrating a fraud on the court punishable by disbarment, but also constitutes clear and undeniable violations of Bar Rules 1.2 and 8.4 prohibiting an attorney from knowingly assisting a client in the commission of a crime or fraudulent act and conduct on the part of an attorney that involves dishonesty, fraud and deceit.

I advised them that I recently viewed my credit report and noticed a collections account from their company and I have n't been notified of this collection. I stated that this did not imply that I refused to pay this alleged debt. Rather, I would like to dispute their claim. As per the FDCPA, I have the right to request a validation of this debt. I requested for them to prove that I am indeed the party who is by contract obligated to pay off this debt. Reporting any invalidated information to major credit bureaus may constitute defamation of character as a negative listing on my credit report does not allow me to enjoy the benefits of good credit. Non compliance of this request Is likely to put their company in serious legal trouble with the Federal Trade Company ( FTC ) and other statewide agencies. 

I requested that they send me the following documents : 1. ) Agreement with their client that authorize them to collect on this alleged debt. 
2. ) Agreement that bears signature of the allege debtor wherein promises to pay the creditor. 
3. ) Complete payment history on this account to prove that the debt amount they wish to collect is correct. 


I receive a letter from them dated XX/XX/17 advising that I have 30 days to dispute the validity of the debt. The following week, I received a copy of an old XXXX bill from Trident Asset Assessment.

1/2/2018,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,"Other features, terms, or problems",Other problem,"I received an email regarding two payments received by CITI. At the time I was expecting and received record of my {$300.00} payment made, received, and cleared. I was then latter informed once during email of a 3rd party {$500.00} payment made to my account. I immediately informed CITI about this. I requested an investigation. Numerous managers at CITI informed me that BOTH the XXXX and the XXXX were legit according to the investigation. 

On or about XX/XX/XXXX CITI falsified documentation on my online statements by placing a Payment Correction of {$500.00}, and at that very time was opposite of what numerous members of their alleged management team informed me upon my own asking ( that the credits, both were legit credits ). 

Just finding out more info today that the {$500.00} in actuality was an error on CITI 's part as they informed me that ( the scenario was another client had made a {$500.00} payment to their account and the payment inadvertently got placed on mine. 

Banks make Errors, Customer make errors. In this case ( 2 ) people at known were impacted ; myself, and the other alleged client based on the information received today XX/XX/XXXX upon my own calling and research. 

CITI recognized that 3rd party payments are a real thing and do happen. I will admit I have made payments to my mothers credit card, and siblings. We all do it, and you probably have done for a family member as well. The fact is I was TOLD verbally by CITI managers on numerous calls that the ( 2 )  credits were legit. At the time there was an over {$400.00} ( CREDIT showing on my account ) because I tend to keep my credit card balances LOW. 

CITI negatively impacted my financial credit score 's utilization which negatively impacts my overall credit score. 

I have a pristine history of paying ontime, and IN FULL as a matter of fact. I deserve even lower APR but that will come soon enough as I manage things very very well. 

CITI pushed my hand with this issue. They initiated the ERROR in the first place. They lied to me the consumer about the facts of the investigation and the result, and never at anytime did CITI notify except with one email that I will share. They have my contact info phone, mail address, email address, secure messaging on their website, but at NO TIME did anyone from CITI contact, or do their job.

They negatively impacted my health as my landlord recently passed, my transmission is failing on my car this days after having to buy new tires for my car. I am XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. You think it is ok for you to just perform financial actions without my legal permission and you think it is ok for you to FAIL to NOTIFY ME? 

Thats not ok. 
This is NOT ok. 
Citi admittedly made an ERROR, and they 're making me pay UNFAIRLY for it. All the time negatively impacting my credit score -- all which I am working on a financial matter that required good behavior on my credit score but CITI is screwing that up, and yet I repeat without notifying the customer. I seriously have no else but to say, XXXX is wrong with CITI. How can they legally falsify/change/redact statements? How can they perform an action which their Fraud department maybe should have followed up with me, or atleast someone but NO ONE DID. 

All this negatively impacted my birthday XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX. This WAS UNFAIR!

I believe mortgage servicing laws require all mortgage statements have the property address associated with the loan on the statement. 

I received a mortgage escrow statement accompanied by a large check. I called the mortgage company PHH to see if they missed one of my insurance renewal payments. Some of my properties have more than one insurance policy. After three ten minute holds a consumer service rep verified my information. She verified my full name, mailing address, loan number and social security number but then would not verify the property address associated with the loan number and mortgage escrow statement I had received and was calling about. I explained I have more than one loan with PHH and I did not know which property this statement was concerning. Without knowing what property we are talking about we could not have an intelligent conversation about any propertys insurance renewal payments. 

I asked to speak with a supervisor and was told no one was available. I was told a supervisor would call me back within 24 hours. No one has ever called me back. The statement shows last years insurance was {$1300.00} and this year they only expect to pay {$590.00}, you would think that would raise concern. 

So now I am in a position where I do not know if the insurance on one of my properties will be renewed. I will only be able to find out after the policy has lapsed and my insurance company sends me a notice of non-renewal for lack of payment. PHH will possibly leave me in a position of great loss if my property is uninsured. The idea they will not tell me which property they missed the insurance renewal payment on is nothing short of negligence. 

I look forward to your assistance with this matter.

I finally reached a manager who told me to send my info to Loss Mitigation - so I sent tons of paperwork to them over a period of another 6 months and now they have sold to Sterling national Bank and no one there ever answers a phone - I have called and left over 100 messages and been on hold for over 4 hours and then it disconnects. I am current on my loan but trying to either work through their process or work with someone else. No other bank will work with me until this issue is resolved but there does not seem to be an actual "" Sterling National Bank '' as they are always serviced by XXXX and no one answers there ever. 

I sent many letters via certified mail and they actually responded to one sent to the president calling me a "" liar '' and saying I had not called multiple times - so I sent them my phone records showing the calls - no response. See copy of letter I sent below. 

XX/XX/XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, New York XXXX Cc : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Dear Gentleman and XXXX XXXX, I am writing regarding our XXXX XXXX - Loan number XXXX This letter details our current situation. We refinanced 7 years ago with XXXX as my husband took an XXXX XXXX position with the United States XXXX XXXX XXXX after many years of XXXX XXXX with the XXXX XXXX XXXX. We were aware that this was an interest only loan 7/1 ARM. We anticipated and were told we had the ability to modify this at any time and we hoped to do so once we knew that my husbands days of XXXX were at an end. 

Six months ago In XX/XX/XXXX, in anticipation of the 7 year period coming to an end and two to three years from my husbands anticipated retirement from the XXXX XXXX and reentry into the workforce, we began the process of an easy refi with XXXX underwriter XXXX XXXX. Two months went by with no word, and after finally getting a hold of XXXX 15 phone calls and emails later. I was told all was in process and that they were missing the {$250.00} check from my packet along with my credit card authorization ( both were included with my paperwork but somehow lost in your office ). That day I federal expressed both items once more to XXXX XXXX. I received paperwork back in XX/XX/XXXX with a letter from XXXX XXXX and talked to him again in XXXX and was told all was in process. 

I began calling again in early XXXX and finally was told by another agent XXXX that we were turned down for this modification due to our debt to income ratio. 

In XXXX I was pre- approved by another bank but choose the option presented to me by XXXX XXXX as it was a competitive interest rate he said it would be a streamlined process, and we could modify for 20 years left on our term. 

In the mean time interest rates have risen 2 percent and my husband in still on XXXX XXXX and we have nowhere left to go. You will not modify our loan in any way. We can not afford the {$3800.00} plus price tag or our mortgage which will adjust in XX/XX/XXXX. 

We could have refinanced with another lender who we qualified with in XX/XX/XXXX but now due to rates being higher and due to his multiple deployments our debts being higher and income lower they tell us we can no longer qualify. 

We have never been late on a single payment of any sort in 10 years. We are good people and my husband is serving his country as he has for 23 years. 

If we had been allowed to refinance for 20 years in a new 5/1 arm or better a 30-year fixed loan with a payment of {$3100.00} as quoted we would be fine but you will not. 


We want to keep our home make a mortgage payment we can afford and pay off our house. 

We have two hardships the fact that my husband is still in the military and the fact that I am self employed for two of my jobs ( I work three jobs my the way ) and you will no longer able to claim my self employment income via stated income and the fact that I write off as much of my expenses on my taxes that is legally allowed much like our current president! 

Can you assist in any way we do not want to stop paying on time as was suggested by your loss mitigation department show said they could not assist unless we were delinquent! We can in now way afford the additional {$700.00} per month until my husband retires in 2-3 years and can take on a better paying career outside of the military. 

Can you work with us for a short term solution or a long term 30 year fixed we can afford Please help a family of patriots who are good people and pay there bills on time we just have a lot of them thanks to this long standing war on terror.

Website # 1 : https : //heartland.ecsi.net/ Website # 2 : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  In late XX/XX/XXXX, I received a final demand notice from the company to make a payment to the loan because I was able to update my personal information since the servicer had an outdated address. I tried calling Heartland to resolve the late payment credit bureau reporting due to the inaccuracy. The representative referred me back to the university and would not even attempt to look into the issue nor would offer any assistance to correcting the error out of my control. He kept saying that the error in credit reporting has to be done by the university, which they do not have any control of. 

Also, when I made the payment, Heartland charged a pass-through fee for "" convenience '' made by a XXXX debit card. I do not believe that fee is legal since Heartland is not a government entity nor a not-for-profit organization since they retain the interest/late fees made on the loans they service.

Being that mistakes on both sides of the contracts, or, presumptive contracts, more likely are apparent. It is believed that working together will solve the issues herein and herewith. Therefore, it is formally requested that assistance be provided by Sir/Madam of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and all its agents or employees in closing the matters timely and quickly. Appendix A is the OVERVIEW of what we discovered that the bank has done with the NOTE, that the fact is the NOTE is our promise to pay, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX hereafter referred to as the Alleged Bank/Lender ( s ) /Servicer ( s ), has monetized our NOTE and turned it into a cash item, and used the Deed of Trust as security for the NOTE. As a result, the Alleged Bank/Lender ( s ) /Servicer ( s ) did not loan its own assets, it loaned credit, a FRAUD, FRAUD IN THE INDUCEMENT, FAILURE OF CONSIDERATION, CONSTRUCTIVE FRAUD, done in CONSPIRACY, an utterly void and without value transaction. All of this is supported and shown by escrow documents as detailed under Appendix B. Appendix C will show the core issue that there is no contract with the Alleged Bank/Lender ( s ) /Servicer ( s ), and will also show the reasons that there is no standing or capacity for the Alleged Bank/Lender ( s ) /Servicer ( s ) ; which leads to our conclusion that the Alleged Bank/Lender ( s ) /Servicer ( s ) has no entitlement, no legal protections without the production of the contract exhibiting all the necessary requirements of a contract by operation of law.

As these matters are very, very, serious for all parties, it is believed cooperation in closing out the issues is paramount. This letter is our act of good faith to correct mistakes. This letter offers release for what could be found to be illegal acts. This letter provides opportunity for all parties to mortgage # XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) and # XXXX ( CAPITAL ONE, N.A. ) to be made whole. Failure by Alleged Bank/Lender ( s ) /Servicer ( s ) to act will be recorded as fact showing intent to deceive, fraud, conversion and other felonies by bank officers. This is simply because the corporation, Alleged Bank/Lender ( s ) /Servicer ( s ) is incapable of felony as it is merely a piece of paper. SYNOPSIS We made mistakes in relying on certain acts by Sir/Madam and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Our reliance was done in contact with professionals operating the mortgage/bank systems. In short, our reliance was induced under professional standard, in our expectation of good faith and clean hands. Since we discovered these errors, a choice to believe said errors are founded on mistakes is foundational for this instrument. In the event Sir/Madam of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  chooses to assist in correction of these mistakes, the following will make us whole and exhibit clean hands by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX 1. The Deed of Trust is cleared of any claim by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX with the transfer of clean title back to XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX. 2. The cash/current funds expended during purchase of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, California, XXXX including of all outlays and payments is to be reimbursed by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. 3.

The parties agree to hold the other harmless for all acts and omissions prior or future ; unless new evidence of a compelling nature is disclosed.

Counter presentments are welcome so long as both parties are closed as to liabilities. Again, please advise us if there is anything incorrect or unfair in what is stated herein. Be advised that in the event these issues are not settled in a reasonable amount of time, seven ( 7 ) days seems appropriate, we will take all appropriate action. In contemplation of corruption of these issues and to prevent abuse of process, this instrument is placed in a time vault, on the World Wide Web ready for massive dissemination. We look forward to resolving the exposed mistakes timely and quickly. Done this XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX 2018, as stated under pains and penalties of perjury under the laws of the United States of America and the State of California. Appendix A OVERVIEW 1. NOTE is our promise to pay at a future time, labor backing both the NOTE and all current funds circulating as currency. 2. Monetizing or securitizing the NOTE turns it into a cash item. 3. Deed of Trust is security for the NOTE. Trust law reverses rules of evidence, Trustee must prove good faith, full disclosure and proper procedures for operations. 4. Escrow is the transfer point between seller, buyer, Title Company, so called lender, where the NOTE is exchanged for deed. 5. Alleged Bank/Lender ( s ) /Servicer ( s ), issued check to escrow under internal request procedure. At time of issuing audits will expose that there is no evidence verifying : a ) source of money ; b ) owned by bank ; c ) at time, or later, of issuing check, all of which is available as proof via public records of corporation. 6. Alleged Bank/Lender ( s ) /Servicer ( s ) issued NSF ( non-sufficient funds ) check. 7. Alleged Bank/Lender ( s ) /Servicer ( s ) never possessed the NOTE until after transfer between seller and buyer, deed for check. 8. Deed of Trust executed at closing of escrow is security for the NOTE. 9. Alleged Bank/Lender ( s ) /Servicer ( s ) later records as sent, NOTE to offset the liability of check. 10. Alleged Bank/Lender ( s ) /Servicer ( s ) records, audited statement, shows conclusively that Alleged Bank/Lender ( s ) /Servicer ( s ), loaned credit, buyers credit, which took place at escrow closing. 11. Alleged Bank/Lender ( s ) /Servicer ( s ) did not loan its own assets, it loaned credit, not even theirs, an ultra vires act, illegal under law and regulating authorities. A FRAUD, FRAUD IN THE INDUCEMENT, FAILURE OF CONSIDERATION, CONSTRUCTIVE FRAUD, done in CONSPIRACY, ISSUE A FRAUDULENT SECURITY, an utterly void and without value transaction. 12. Transfer of Title to registry systems or second servicer is fraudulent. 13. Bank claims abandoned funds after three ( 3 ) years. This is double payment and never disclosed. 14. Deed of Trust is fraudulent, resulting in defective Title, unmarketable title. Appendix B Each of these statements is shown by escrow documents. The Alleged Bank/Lender ( s ) /Servicer ( s ), or so called lenders acts are shown as follows : 1. Balance sheet relating to the original loan, shows ledgering of the account as required to be reported and open knowledge under 12 USC 242, 347 and proved by XXXX reports available from IRS. 2. The 424 B-5 prospect reports shows filing facts concerning the security issued under the note and Deed of Trust without reporting bases of the derivative. 3. Securities and Exchange Commission Reports S 3 A shows the sale of the note and form of item sold. 4. FASB ( Financial Accounting Standards Board ) forms 125, 133, 140, 5, 95 guides an auditor to the liability side of the banks books, exposing exactly where the money came from and shows where it went and under what procedure and instrument. 5. The NOTE as negotiable instrument falls under UCC. 6. There is never a receipt given for the deposit of value. 7. 12 USC 1813 ( L ) ( I ) discloses that deposit of a promissory note is cash to the Alleged Bank/Lender ( s ) /Servicer ( s ). The Alleged Bank/Lender ( s ) /Servicer ( s ) s cash is our cash, not the Alleged Bank/Lender ( s ) /Servicer ( s ) ; the proof is the bogus loan paper. 8. There was never a receipt issued for the cash deposit. 9. The notes transferred at a transaction account creates an asset on the payable side of the ledger ; while on the liability side of the ledger, the NOTE issued by the presumed buyer/borrower is sold after monetizing. 10. First funds transfer or hold absolute right to the NOTE or cash equivalent. 11. XXXX OID identifies the principal issuer. Deed of trust is required to be registered as evidence of debt. Notes are not so required. Sale of unregistered security sets up right of rescission as a property right absolute. Conclusion based on evidence publicly available is that the transaction between buyer and Alleged Bank/Lender ( s ) /Servicer ( s ) is a fraud. The mistake may have resulted from standard practice, procedures, application on part of Alleged Bank/Lender ( s ) /Servicer ( s ) or, it may not. In either instance the predicate facts are result in the issues herein. Appendix C In Appendix B, we discovered that the whole mortgage was a fraud from the beginning. Webelieve Wehave discovered the core issue is that there is no contract with the bank, there is no standing or capacity for the Alleged Bank/Lender ( s ) /Servicer ( s ), its agents and its servicers because : 1. We have no contract with the Alleged Bank/Lender ( s ) /Servicer ( s ). 2. The Alleged Bank/Lender ( s ) /Servicer ( s ) never placed on the files of this matter its corporate delegation, or its minutes authorizing to entry into a contract with us. 3. There is no officer identified with corporate authority attached or corporate authority to engage a contract with us. 4. The corporate charter for Alleged Bank/Lender ( s ) /Servicer ( s ) does not authorize its taking of our note to fund a Alleged Bank/Lender ( s ) /Servicer ( s ) s liability, escrow check, exchanged for issuers, our note, obligation to pay at close of escrow on specific time line. 5. The Alleged Bank/Lender ( s ) /Servicer ( s ) issued a NSF ( non-sufficient funds ) check to escrow prior to having possession of the assets, NOTE issued by us. 6. The Alleged Bank/Lender ( s ) /Servicer ( s ) s charter, state law and federal law do not authorize Alleged Bank/Lender ( s ) /Servicer ( s ) to lend credit, no matter the source of the credit. 7. The Alleged Bank/Lender ( s ) /Servicer ( s ) s charter limits the Alleged Bank/Lender ( s ) /Servicer ( s ) to specific acts ; all acts outside its legal or corporate authority being ultra vires, of no effect, utterly void. In this matter, the payments made by us to the Alleged Bank/Lender ( s ) /Servicer ( s ) were induced under fraud, the illegal acts above, which voids any claim by Alleged Bank/Lender ( s ) /Servicer ( s ). The creation of debt by lenders, the Deed of Trust and Promissory Note, payment of or agreement to pay money to the debtor, the Alleged Bank/Lender ( s ) /Servicer ( s ), or to a third party for account of debtor, the Alleged Bank/Lender ( s ) /Servicer ( s ), is not a contract. Assumption of contract being in place for collection process requires that the contract be produced ; it is never produced because there is no contract. The creation of debt by a credit to an account with the lender, Deed of Trust and Promissory Note, upon which the debtor, the Alleged Bank/Lender ( s ) /Servicer ( s ), is entitled to draw immediately such as the NSF check exchange for the NOTE, does not create a contract nor obligation. Failure by Alleged Bank/Lender ( s ) /Servicer ( s ) to produce bona fide contract is admission to inducement to part with valuable consideration in exchange for nothing but a different instrument. None the less, the only value issued is by us, which is able to be shown through Alleged Bank/Lender ( s ) /Servicer ( s ) documents which are public record, audits and corporate reports. We will, if needed, subpoena the records mentioned above in order to prove the points herein. The Alleged Bank/Lender ( s ) /Servicer ( s ) appears to have failed : to operate under these legal principals, covered by, UCC , the laws governing consumer credit and usury, the providing of rate ceilings to assure adequate supply of credit to consumers ; to educate consumers for understanding the terms of credit transactions ; to keep so called lenders honest through competition for credit at reasonable cost ; to protect so called consumers against illegal acts ; to keep fair and sound consumer credit practices ; to comply with FEDERAL TRUTH IN LENDING ACT ; and to equalize all jurisdictions. Consumers in the above context are XXXX XXXX XXXX  and XXXX XXXX XXXX. In reality the Alleged Bank/Lender ( s ) /Servicer ( s ), XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX is the consumer of our credit, who issued that product, the NOTE, promise to pay, representing labor as the source of value. The Alleged Bank/Lender ( s ) /Servicer ( s ) did not provide the goods, the NOTE or the labor backing it, did not manufacture the credit represented by the NOTE. None the less, the user of the product, the NOTE representing real value, labor is the buyer of the NOTE through a fraudulent inducement as outlined above, which is the Alleged Bank/Lender ( s ) /Servicer ( s ). The Alleged Bank/Lender ( s ) /Servicer ( s ) as outlined herein has no entitlement, no legal protections without production of the contract exhibiting all the necessary requirements of a contract by operation of law.

1/3/2018,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Closing on a mortgage,,"Here is a quick background on the case : 1. Purchaser, entered into a contract to build and purchase the home from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX referred to as Seller on XX/XX/XXXX.

2. The contract was for the purchase of the above home by the Purchaser for the purpose of primary residence, as indicated in the contract. 3. The P
urchaser worked diligently with the Lender, NVR Mortgage Finance , Inc., referred to as NVRM within the contract and secured a loan approval for the above purchase. NVRM and Seller are both owned by one larger corporate body. Therefore, as stipulated in the contract, the Purchaser had secured a loan approval 45 days within the date of the agreement signed on XX/XX/XXXX.

4. Purchaser worked with NVRM and responded to all information requests as well as met all conditions set forth for securing a loan on the above purchase.

5. Furthermore, Purchaser was transparent and kept NVRM and Seller informed of all status changes, specifically, the change in the employment starting XX/XX/XXXX During this time, the Purchaser certified their intent to occupy the above residence as their primary residence. NVRM requested a certification to this effect which was provided as well.

6. The Settlement Date communicated to Purchaser was XX/XX/XXXX in preparation for which, the Purchaser met with the Construction Project Manager on XX/XX/XXXX in good faith for a final walk-through of the home.

7. NVRM communicated to the Purchaser onXX/XX/XXXX that they would be unable to secure financing on the property as a primary residence due to change in employment.

Based on the above, the Purchaser has 2 options as explained by NVRM representative, on XX/XX/XXXX : O

ption 1 : Seek financing on the above property as an investment home which entails higher interest rate and substantially higher down payment requirement. This is not financially viable and would put severe financial stress on the Purchaser. Option 2 : Purchaser terminate the contract due to lack of financing as a primary residence and lose the ~ $ XXXX in hand money.

With reference to option 2, the Purchaser has been in compliance with the conditions set forth in the purchase agreement and has done everything in good faith to purchase the home. The inability of NVRM to secure a loan as a primary residence for the Purchaser does not constitute a breach of contract by the Purchaser.

As outlined in section 12 ( b ) of the contract : 12 ( b ) Default-Seller. We will be deemed to be in default upon Our failure ( 1 ) to complete Settlement as required hereunder ; or ( 2 ) to perform the obligations required to be performed by Us hereunder prior to Settlement, unless You are in default. Your sole and exclusive remedy if We default shall be to recover Your Deposit ( as defined in Paragraph 2 and to the extent previously paid to Us ) plus interest on Your Deposit at the legal rate since the date of Our breach or default, plus the sum of XXXX XXXX Dollars ( {$1000.00} ) as liquidated damages and not a penalty ( which sum is a reasonable estimate of actual damages which can not be forecasted with certainty ), in return for which You and We shall be automatically released from this Agreement and You would have no further rights to the Property.

Based on the facts of the case listed above, the Seller, its agent ( NVRM ) or its representatives were requested to cancel the contract and refund the hand money to Purchaser.

The Seller called they Purchaser after XXXX XXXX on XXXX and pressurized the seller to seek another mortgage after being denied mortgage from their lender of choice.

The loan amount should be limited to XXXX for individuals. ( see below link and quote from the XXXX XXXX website ) My XXXX account was allowed to hemorrhage ; become over leveraged and my investments went from XXXX in deposits to a final balance of $ XXXX. I used some of the XXXX balance but I was living off the XXXX since I am XXXX with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. The Loan Management Account is not a suitable vehicle for an older woman who has no other source of income. I learned this too late. When my husband XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX I agreed to assume the loan balance of approx. XXXX but at that point I should NOT have been allowed to leverage any more of my investments. 

ML OFFICIAL LOAN MANAGEMENT DESCRIPTION : XXXX XXXX XXXX "" The XXXX account is an  uncommitted facility, although loans to individuals and trusts may be  committed in an amount not to exceed {$100000.00}. The Bank may demand full or partial repayment at any time and any commitment may be immediately terminated. '' I recently became aware of this regulation limiting the loan amount to individuals. 
Not only did the loan balance exceed XXXX but my entire set of funds were used as collateral. XXXX XXXX charged interest on the loan balance from approximately 3.3 % to 4.4 %. 

In XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX I communicated with FINRA and requested mediation with XX/XX/XXXX through FINRA. XXXX XXXX denied my request and blames the destruction of my resources to my spending. As previously said I was living off my investments. I paid for my son 's wedding. Spending is not the issue. XXXX XXXX broke their own law by over leveraging my Loan Management Account. If the XXXX XXXX stipulated limit of XXXX for individuals was honored and enforced I would not have lost all of my funds. 

Essentially the Loan Management Account became a runaway train that eventually crashed. My Loan Management Account was not properly supervised and not lawfully enforced.

1/3/2018,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Problem caused by your funds being low,Overdrafts and overdraft fees,"I noticed my bank account had a 2nd debit from a merchant I did not authorize on XX/XX/XXXX. I called my bank ( WellsFargo ) to inform them that the 2nd payment was not authorized. This payment caused a domino effect in my bank account. I did not have the money available, so money was pulled from my savings account. This caused me to receive a fee from Wells Fargo for them transferring the money and now I believe I may have an overdraft fee. I spoke to the merchant on XX/XX/XXXX and they stated they could not do anything to stop it because they have not received the money. They told me they ca n't refund what they have not received. ( Makes sense ) So, I called Wells Fargo to see if they can stop the payment to the merchant since it was showing as pending on my bank account and not a posted transaction. Let 's just say that Wells Fargo is full of XXXX. They told me it was nothing they could do because they do n't have anything to do with the way payments are processed. I asked to speak to a manager and the manager gave me two options : 1 ) I could do a stop check, which means they may catch it in time but it would not guarantee that my funds would be available immediately or 2 ) I could open up a claim to see if they could do a provisional credit today ( she made no guarantees and she put in the claim and transferred me to the claims department ) I was literally crying on the phone to her and the previous agent that transferred me that I did not have any money in my account and that I could not get gas in my car. My account was in a negative status due to this charge. I said I have been a customer with your bank for over 10 years and I ca n't believe there is nothing you can do. I am speaking with the Claims Specialists and he told me he could not see the claim because it was just entered, but if he could see it, he could potentially expedite it. I said well can you just create another one and delete that one. He said that it would mess up the process. I was on the phone with him for probably an hour, let 's just say it was not a good call. I was really upset by this point and I was very short with him. So, fast forward to XX/XX/XXXX, I see that Wells Fargo paid the merchant. I called them to expedite my claim. I spoke with XXXX from the claims department, who would not give me her employer ID or something to identify her. ( She says they do n't have that ) She told me that there was nothing that Wells Fargo could do because it was an auto-pay. I was livid!!! I said to her that you guys just wasted my time. The claim specialists knew on the call yesterday what type of charge it was, why did he not say anything about this. She said that maybe he was not an investigator, I said that he told me he was and he could have expedited my claim. Let me add on to the fact that she had me re-verify all the information that was done through the VRU and the transferring agent had already chatted with me about the account. Plus, I find it odd that she asked for so much verification, more than I have ever been asked before. I asked her what happens if the merchant decides not to give me money back, she then there is nothing Wells Fargo can do. So, I am telling you an authorized payment was done to my bank account with Wells Fargo and there is nothing they can do. I am not happy with Wells Fargo, I have received fees from this charge. The merchant is willing to admit they are wrong and I offered to conference call them several times with Wells Fargo on the line, they out right refused.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,WELLS FARGO & COMPANY,VA,23231,,Consent provided,Web,1/3/2018,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,N/A,2770998

( II ) Notice effective for subsequent submissions. After proving such notice, the Financial institution may submit additional negative information to a consumer reporting agency described in section 603 ( p ) with respect to the same transaction, extension of credit, account, or customer without providing additional notice to the customer. 

( B ) Time of notice ( I ) In general, the notice required under subparagraph ( A ) shall be provided to the customer prior to, or no later than 30 days after, furnishing the negative information to a consumer reporting agency described in section 603 ( p ).

( II ) Coordination with new account disclosures. If the notice is provided to the customer prior to furnishing the negative information to a consumer reporting agency, the notice may not be included in the initial disclosures provided under section 127 ( a ) of the truth in lending act.

I was very surprised Chase let this huge charge for computer equipment go through with no flag, for items which I NEVER buy. I 've had {$5.00} XXXX charges and clothing sales flagged by CHASE, which are most of my purchases. 

-CHASE Customer service ( XX/XX/XXXX ) : I immediately called Chase customer service and tell the representative that I received and signed for the equipment no knowing what it was. If I had not received it, the fraud may have gone unnoticed for a bit since I had not made any recent purchases. We discussed how the hacker was not too bright as he forgot to change my delivery address to his address. We also discussed the fact that I have no idea what a "" motherboard '' is or how to use a "" compute and graphics '' card that I received. She assures me charges will be reversed and passes me on to a fraud specialist. She does not instruct me what to do with these items. 

-CHASE Fraud specialist ( XX/XX/XXXX ) : I am passed to her and reiterate my story, and she confirms the charges will be reversed. She does not instruct me what to do with these items. I ask her "" So now what do I do with this stuff? '' I am told by her "" you can keep it ''. In no uncertain terms. I do not question it, as I believe this is Chases policy to write off the loss, as it was their error. I assume the issue has been resolved. I assumed CHASE does not make the customer assume full liability of returning to a person/company they never ordered from. 
**Again I would like to note : I was given NO instructions from either representative about what to do with the items. It was after I PROACTIVELY ASKED this question, I was told to KEEP IT. Here is the crux of the story. And please keep in mind their calls are recorded. 

-XX/XX/XXXX & XX/XX/XXXX : I 'm sure you wonder what happened to the items. Well after being told BY CHASE these items were mine to keep, and given the fact I have no personal use for them, I posted on XXXX asking if anyone was interested ( I forwarded Chase Executive Office this information as well ). After no luck, I try to sell on XXXX to benefit XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, which did not sell. I sell the other item but a week later, but a fraudulent buyer claimed item was "" defective '' with XXXX picture and XXXX just gave it away to him for free ( I have documentation for all of this, as well as a XXXX post where I recapped the story in real time ). In process, I lost XXXX out of pocket in shipping costs as well. I reposted the other item on XX/XX/XXXX which sold at less than half the cost, minus XXXX seller fees, XXXX shipping. I then donated 20 % of this to the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( that donation is reflected in my XX/XX/XXXX credit statement ), as I  always planned to use proceeds toward charity. 

-XX/XX/XXXX : Fast forward 2 months after l first received the items and called CHASE about it. XXXX XXXX from fraud investigations department calls out of the blue and tells me she is taking over the case from a previous rep. She threatens me that "" Someone needs to pay for this! '' and tells me she "" found out '' in her investigation that I signed for these items. This is not new news or a gotcha moment as XXXX believes, because I TOLD Chase that when I called them two months ago. "" You signed for it - you are responsible! '' is what I am told. She said the $ XXXX in charges will now be reversed back to my account. 

I told XXXX that CHASE does have a recording of the conversation on XX/XX/XXXX. She replies, "" There are no notes in the file and I do n't know who you spoke with. It probably was n't one of us ''. Us who? I called CHASE. Clearly she never checked the recording and did not care to investigate further with who I spoke with. XXXX had a quota to make for the end of the year and wanted a closed case with CHASE admitting no fault or liability. If XXXX were truly ethical and doing an actual INVESTIGATION instead of a witch hunt, she could have pulled this phone call recording, spoken with the reps I talked to that day and confirmed what I said. Instead she insinuated that a decent, hard working 20 year customer was a the liar, fraud, and thief. 

I asked CHASE what to do and they instructed me. CHASE IS TAKING NO ACCOUNTABILITY HERE. Easier to fault the little guy and have them pay for your mistakes, I presume. Instead of addressing the fact you have representatives who put customers at severe financial jeopardy by providing misinformation, you will hold the customer liable. EVIL CORPORATION. 

- XX/XX/XXXX : Just received XXXX 's XXXX letter in the mail, closing her "" investigation '' and it states that she is closing it because I confirmed the charges were legitimate. THIS IS COMPLETELY FALSE INFORMATION SHE HAS PROVIDED ON AN OFFICIAL CHASE DOCUMENT. Here I am at maximum credit card balance with the holidays, and TERRIFIED that XXXX was just added to my account that I do not have, and my good credit is now being ruined by this power hungry brute who gets her marching orders from an evil corporation with no conscience. 

But I have a clear conscience. I communicated with CHASE all along the way, told the truth and did as THEY instructed me. I have nothing to hide. I do what is right. I clearly was misled and assumed that I could trust CHASE, trust what I was being told, and that this case was closed long ago on XX/XX/XXXX. 

For them to now blindside me 2 FULL MONTHS LATER and do a COMPLETE REVERSAL OF ORIGINAL DIRECTION is unethical, rotten, disgusting, and an abuse of power. I could not change the circumstances now if I wanted to, as I long since have gotten rid of these items, can not get them back, received only a fraction of their value at best. Truly they have been nothing but a curse and I would have much preferred for CHASE to take responsibility and get them shipped back from me. As a solid customer of 20 years, I am being treated like a thief and fraud, rather than Chase owning their responsibility in this. 

This is now putting me in impossible financial hardship. I am beyond words on this and have no one to turn to. Frustrated, shocked, angry, terrified.",,JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.,CA,92625,,Consent provided,Web,1/3/2018,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,N/A,2771294

I have had confirmation that I was part of the XXXX hack and XXXX hack. All of the following occurred on XX/XX/2018. On XX/XX/2018 I received a notice from XXXX that an application for credit had been filed. I called XXXX and determined this was not an application completed by me. I was assigned an agent, XXXX XXXX. Together we called the company noted, XXXX. This is a 3rd party vendor who contracts with XXXX. XXXX would tell me very little information, but would mail or fax the information within 5 business days. This would NOT stop the fraudulent application. XXXX would not give me the name of the company the application was for. 

I called XXXX. I was disconnected 6 times and got a busy signal 2 times. I got disconnected because there was no option to reach a person. I just got to the end of the call tree and then was disconnected. I tried multiple numbers. I called XXXX at XXXX back to get help. She was able to connect with XXXX because she could connect as business to business - that was not an option for me. After waiting on the line for more than an hour, I was able to find out that an application from a company called XXXX XXXX XXXX was filed in my name. Please note, I can only find this information out by taking to a person. I said this was fraudulent and was told by XXXX this would be disputed. I asked for a security freeze and XXXX charged me {$7.00} even though this was fraudulent. They said they had to charge me because I did n't have a police report. I do n't have a police report because XXXX  made it impossible to get the information I would need to file a report. I decided that after spending so much time, I would pay the {$7.00}. My time is worth something and in no way to do I want to have to call back and spend 2 more hours of my life trying to get a freeze on my credit. However, I find it ridiculous that I need a police report to "" prove '' the fraud when I am talking to them on the phone telling them I did n't complete an application for a loan with XXXX XXXX XXXX that was filed with their company! 

XXXX stated that I would need to put a freeze at Trans Union and XXXX  because the companies do n't share this inforamation. XXXX was free because of their security breech, but TransUnion would charge me without a police report. So I called my local police and filed a report and got an incident report number. The officer came to my workplace and completed the complaint using a phone and gave me a complaint ID number. He said I would need the complaint ID number for the freeze. I then called TransUnion and was told I had to provide a paper report or they would charge me {$7.00}. Since the report was taken by using a phone, there was no paper report. In my mind I think, I can hang up and go through the steps to get a paper report ( so much for paper reduction ) but that would take more time. I need the freeze now. People are making fraudulent applications in my name now. Today. Not in 5 business days. 

The money is not much. However, this is just unacceptable behavior by these companies. They make it very difficult to do the right thing.

XX/XX/XXXX I had my monthly payment deducted from my bank account. On XX/XX/XXXX I made a phone call to Great Lakes to make and excess payment on my account. I asked the representative if I could make a payment to completely pay off my remaining three loans sitting at 6.550 % interest. She stated that this would be no problem and that my payment would be {$2800.00} to completely pay off the three separate loans at the interest rate of 6.550 % ( loan # XXXX, # XXXX, and # XXXX ). The excess payment of {$2800.00} was taken from my bank account on XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX I received an email from Great Lakes stating, "" Your Excess Payment Preference Has Expired. '' Due to the holidays I was unable to contact Great Lakes until XX/XX/XXXX. I called Great Lakes customer service on XX/XX/XXXX to question what had happened with my excess payment. They stated that my excess payment of {$2800.00} had not been correctly applied to the three loans ( loan # XXXX, # XXXX, and # XXXX ), and had instead only payed off loan # XXXX completely and partially payed off loan # XXXX and # XXXX. As of XX/XX/XXXX loan # XXXX still had a balance on {$110.00}, and loan # XXXX still had a balance of {$190.00}. I questioned how this could be as I specifically stated which loans I had wanted my excess payment to be applied toward. She responded that part of the excess payment had in fact gone to loans that were not those that had been request and that she would correct the problem and I would be able to see this correction within the standard 2-3 business days. I received a phone call from Great Lakes XX/XX/XXXX to which they explained that the excess payment of {$2800.00} had to first pay off my scheduled monthly payment of {$370.00} before any excess could be used towards the loans of my choosing. This confused me as I had already paid my schedule monthly payment of {$370.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. They said that it was my XX/XX/XXXX payment that had been deducted before any excess payment could be applied. I then asked if I was still scheduled to pay my XX/XX/XXXX payment and they said that I would still be expected to pay {$370.00} as schedule on XX/XX/XXXX. This in my eyes did not add up. While discussing this on the phone I logged into my online account at Great Lakes to look at my loans myself. It was then that I noticed loan # XXXX now had a balance of {$0.00} when just the day before XX/XX/XXXX it had been XXXX ( confirmed by a Great Lakes representative on the phone call placed XX/XX/XXXX ). I then opened loan # XXXX and saw that the balance was now {$300.00} when just the day before XX/XX/XXXX it had been {$110.00}. This was very alarming to me and it had occurred to me that a representative of Great Lakes that I had spoken to XX/XX/XXXX moved {$190.00} from loan # XXXX to loan # XXXX thus putting the loan balance of # XXXX to {$300.00} ( not correcting the error at all, just moving money from one account to another ). I believe that this is fraud. I never once authorized money to be moved from one loan to another. This is alarming to me that Great Lakes would make such changes to loans that were taken out separately, signed for separately and should never be combined or moved without consent of the holder. When I stated my concerns to the account representative from Great Lakes she said she was unable to see if money had been moved from one account to another. She stated that she could only see the current balances of my accounts and unable to see what the balances had been just one day prior. She danced around my questions and tried to make it seem like I was the one who was not understanding the situation.

In the past, I have submitted a complaint to the CFPB about Volkswagen 's unfair practices with respect to collecting and remitting personal property tax payments. 

I moved to XXXX XXXX from XXXX XXXX in XXXX. I registered my leased VW in XXXX  effective XX/XX/XXXX. VW charged me around {$50.00} to process my title paperwork. They did not disclose these fees to me. They simply tacked them on to my next month 's statement. Given that they charged me to process my paperwork, they should know that my car is registered in XXXX. 

Despite the fact that my car was registered in Pennsylvania, VW paid my XXXXXXXX XXXX personal property tax through XX/XX/XXXX. This means they overpaid my property tax by over 6 months. I was charged an additional {$530.00} on my XX/XX/XXXX statement for the Property/Excise tax. Because I am registered in auto-payments, this amount ( in addition ) to my monthly payment was sucked out of my account on my normal payment date. VW should have realized based on processing my title work that my car was not garaged in XXXX or registered in XXXX from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX. As a result, I was overbilled by roughly {$300.00}. 

When I contacted VW, their customer service agent confirmed that my personal property tax was paid through XX/XX/XXXX. When I told her that I no longer lived in XXXX and had not for over half the year, she told me that I had to submit a registration card to prove that I no longer lived in XXXX.

I called XXXX XXXX customer service that following year in XX/XX/XXXX to ask them to increase my escrow amount given that the first years taxes were on my land value only and did not include my improvements ( my property ). I had an estimated bill from my county that showed the new escrow amount but they would not allow the increase. I then asked if I could send them extra funds so that there would be a sufficietn amount in escrow to pay taxes at which time they stated that any extra money would be applied to principal only. Given this outcome, I was forced to wait until XXXX XXXX paid my taxes at which time my account is now in the negative {$3000.00}. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I recieved an escrow analysis detailing this event and was given two options : 1. Do nothing and my mortgage increases to {$2700.00} from {$1900.00} and 2. Pay {$5500.00} and my mortgage payment increases to {$2300.00}.

1/5/2018,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Problem with a lender or other company charging your account,Transaction was not authorized,"On XX/XX/XXXX my purse was stolen including my driver 's license, credit/atm cards, checkbook and keys. I reported the theft and it is in a XXXX Police Report. I cancelled my Bank of America ( BOA ) cards, stopped payment on the missing checks, and removed most of the funds from my checking account. 

On XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX, three deductions totaling {$5500.00} were made from the BOA checking account belonging to my husband and me for "" returned item chargeback ''. Apparently, on XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX, someone presented my stolen id, and BOA cashed 3 third party checks totaling {$5500.00}. This was despite the fact that there were not sufficient funds in the checking account to cover any one of the third party checks. 

On XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX, we met with a local BOA official who initiated a BOA fraud investigation, referencing the XXXX Police Report number. He put a "" fraud hold '' on the account, and we discussed options for my safety deposit boxes since the thief had both my id and my deposit box keys. Ultimately, I re-keyed both boxes. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I was contacted by the BOA fraud investigator. I told her that my TX driver 's license was stolen which displayed my signature, along with checks, cards, etc. I also referred her to a second identity theft incident using my cancelled checks and gave the XXXX County report number. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, without any communication, BOA move funds from savings accounts of ourselves and our child to cover the overdraft in the checking account. I met with a BOA official at a local branch, who indicated that the fraud claim was denied, but that she initiated a "" reconsideration request ''. She said they would email me the denial letter, which they did not do.

Based on our research, identification belonging the account holder was used and we have n't been advised that your identification was lost or stolen. '' Between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, we contacted BOA at least 9 times via the fraud department customer phone lines, letters, and local BOA officials.

12/25/2017,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Fees or interest,Charged too much interest,"On XX/XX/XXXX I called the Member Service number listed on my credit card statement for XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, because the interest amount charged of {$47.00} was excessive, it calculates to an annual rate of 51 % instead of the stated 23.99 % on the statement. After over 1 hour 30 minutes on the phone, most of it on hold I was told the Balance Subject to Interest Rate was claimed to be {$2400.00}, which was nearly 1.5 times the actual balance of {$1100.00} for the month interest was to be charged. My payment is usually due on the XX/XX/XXXX of the month. I typically pay my balance in full so there is no interest charged. In XX/XX/XXXX, the month the interest was charged I missed the payment date and paid two days late due to thinking I had set up the payment the previous week. The interest charge I am challenging does NOT include the late fee. That fee is legitimate but the interest charge is not. The balance due on XX/XX/XXXX was {$1100.00}. Even if the credit card company abuses the consumer with a two month calculation that still doesnt justify the interest charge. The balance due in XX/XX/XXXX was {$510.00}. The company refused to explain the calculation, there is no rational way to figure out how they exploit the customer and manipulate the effective interest rate to be far in excess of the claimed interest rate. After one hour and 45 minutes another representative came on the phone and continued to argue the rate and still refused to explain how they were fraudulently calculating my interest charge. After 2 hours and 1 minute I put the phone down and ignored the lying and dismissive attitude until the representative hung up. It became abundantly clear that there was no interest by the company to be honest and forthright regarding their fraudulent manipulation of balances. I will be making my payment due XX/XX/XXXX on time but I expect a new exorbitant interest charge on my statement due XX/XX/XXXX. In the fine print on the back of the statement it says the bank calculates the Balance Subject to Interest Rate by using an average daily balance method. It explains that calculation uses the daily balances during the billing cycle. Using that method it would still be impossible to achieve the Balance Subject to Interest Rate of {$2400.00} unless they are using the balance from the NEXT month. Because remember the previous months balance due, paid on the XX/XX/XXXX, the month before month the interest was due for was {$510.00}. Assuming that I made one charge of {$1100.00} on the first day of the billing cycle due on XX/XX/XXXX, the whole balance would still only be {$1600.00}, or roughly 2/3 of the claimed Balance Subject to Interest Rate of {$2400.00}.

I do n't answer random numbers so I blocked some and just let others ring for weeks. After about two months i decided to answer it and it was my Bank ( Bank Of America ) calling from an automated line and I was furious after finding out that it was an automated line blowing up my phone for months. This was a call to collect a debt. I was so confused what I was in debt for so I called the number they gave me. I 'm always so scared to fall behind on my credit card which is why I set up automatic payments to come straight out of my XXXX debit card to pay my BOA credit card. So I decided to call and after waiting on hold for 10 mins they had told me that my credit card is almost {$700.00} past due. How is this possible when my credit card limit is only {$500.00}. I should have only only had about a {$200.00} balance on this card. They never told me that those automatic payments expire after a year. They had all the wrong information in there system. They had the wrong address so I was not getting the statements to be warned I was missing payments. The lady I spoke with had told me I can have these late fees waived and I said yes absolutely, however i would have to pay the initial {$200.00} balance before waiving the fees. I paid the balance off and updated my info in the system and she said I would get my new statement in about a week. I finally got it today which was about three weeks later and it still says I owe {$350.00}. Futhermore they set up my automatic payments again to start paying for the late charges. The fees were never waived and I dont think it is very fair that I owe them this money when I received zero notification of the late fees and the fact that my automatic payments expired. Not to mention in the process of this they revoked this credit card, so I have no credit card anymore and they still expect me to pay these fees when Ive already paid what ive used on the card.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION",NY,11754,,Consent provided,Web,1/5/2018,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,N/A,2772156

In the Divorce Decree between myself and XXXX XXXX XXXX is a SPECIAL WARRANTY DEED, which is NOT THE same as a Quit Claim Deed. I have checked this with several Lawyers and even with the FBI. So, instead of fixing the problem, XXXX decides to CLOSE the offending case file, then open a NEW ONE, again without my signature. So, since XXXX XXXX XXXX can not pay on time, it shows up on my credit report. This is getting very tiresome, and this is exactly what XXXX XXXX was fined XXXX of dollars for, opening accounts without permission from those people. I want this stopped immediately. 

This is their response for Complaint # XXXX : We 've been unable to establish contact with you regarding you concerns about the credit reporting of your account. A Divorce Decree and/or Special Warranty Deed may transfer title to the property, but it does n't affect the original terms of the Note. Since you 're a customer under the Note, we 'll continue to report this account under your name to the consumer reporting agencies. On XX/XX/XXXX, we mailed you a notice that we were making a change to our servicing system. We did not open a new account for your loan, we simply moved your existing account to another servicing system within XXXX XXXX. Effective XX/XX/XXXX, your loan number changed from XXXX to XXXX. The account is currently due for the XX/XX/XXXX payment. 

I have never been contacted with any of this information. Ever. I am willing to submit my home phone number logs ( XXXX ) XXXX or my cell phone logs ( XXXX ) XXXX as evidence in Federal Court to prove that they never bothered to attempt contact. As I am a Federal Law Enforcement Officer, they have committed a Felony under 18 USC 1001. XXXX XXXX continually commits the exact same type of Fraud that they were convicted of in Federal Court. Also, they FAIL TO MENTION that they CHANGED the note WITHOUT my signature or consent, their OWN paperwork shows where my SIGNATURE is REQUIRED, yet they changed the NOTE at that point.

In the Divorce Decree between myself and XXXX XXXX XXXX is a SPECIAL WARRANTY DEED, which is NOT THE same as a Quit Claim Deed. I have checked this with several Lawyers and even with the FBI. So, instead of fixing the problem, XXXX decides to CLOSE the offending case file, then open a NEW ONE, again without my signature.

This is their response for Complaint # XXXX : We 've been unable to establish contact with you regarding you concerns about the credit reporting of your account.

In her response, XXXX says that "" these transactions occurred from XXXX XXXX through XXXX XXXX, when you closed the account '' and that "" during the time the charges in question were being made by XXXX XXXX, neither you nor XXXX XXXX sought to terminate XXXX XXXX ability to use the account, or informed FNBO of any concerns about the charges XXXX XXXX was making. Rather, the billing statements that reflected these charges were consistently paid. '' I did not know until the fall of XXXX, when I came to XXXX, TX to review my mother 's finances and put her in XXXX XXXX, that she even had a credit card with you, let alone that her grandson was using it. As soon as I found out what was going on, I closed the account, telling your company that I strongly suspected fraud on XXXX XXXX XXXX part, and I also asked for a copy of past billing statements. After I received the billing statements from XXXX XXXX to XXXX XXXX, I reviewed them and discovered over 250 mysterious charges that we determined where from offshore illegal gambling companies. Once we were able to ascertain what the charges were and totaled them up, we talked to your company on the phone about them, but were told you would n't remove these illegal gambling charges. After that, we submitted a claim with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau on XXXX XXXX, XXXX with Case No. XXXX. 

FNBO 's position is that, according to the response they provided for this claim on XXXX XXXX, XXXX to CFPB, "" FNBO relies on payment system operator policies and procedures designed to thwart unlawful Internet gambling. The UIGEA does not obligate FNBO to police proactively for potential illegal activities underlying charges made on credit card accounts. '' However, according to your own deposit agreement as seen at https : //www.firstnational.com/common/iws/pdf/deposit_agreement.pdf, you say on Page 25 of the document that "" You agree not to use your account for unlawful internet gambling. We may block any Transaction that we identify as a restricted Transaction under the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006 or other applicable law. '' On Page 32 of that agreement, FNBO also says that cardholders "" agree not to use your card to engage in illegal activity or online gambling. '' It says nothing there about relying on "" payment system operator policies and procedures designed to thwart unlawful Internet gambling '' while you stick your fingers in your ears and proclaim to be shocked, shocked gambling was going on with an FNBO  credit card. No, the agreement says that you "" may block any Transaction that we identify as a restricted Transaction under the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006 or other  applicable law. '' So why would you allow such transactions to go on? Why did your company not identify over 250 offshore gambling charges, with foreign transaction fees to XXXX and XXXX, when we could figure out what they were shortly after first seeing them? Most credit card companies can pick up such shenanigans quickly. Why did n't yours? 
Note that you are not denying that these are illegal online gambling charges. At any rate. you would think that after the 5th or 10th strange foreign transaction fee connected with a company with a name like "" XXXX XXXX, '' that your computers ' algorithms would realize something was awry. Instead, you let over 250 such transactions go through without any issue, or with giving any alert to the primary cardholder. My mother was in her mid-XXXX by then, had XXXX XXXX, was not internet-savvy and did not grasp what her grandson was doing with the card. Instead, she paid the bills without understanding what those mysterious charges were. It was your company 's job to protect her, and you failed. 

So we are still seeking the sum of {$11000.00} to be removed from this account.

1/5/2018,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,,"To Whom It May Concern at Consumer Protection Financial Bureau : XX/XX/XXXX # XXXX I am writing in response to Freedom Mortgages ( FM ) statement from XXXX XXXX XXXX. I will use CSR for Customer Service Representative in my response. 
I apologize to you for not getting back sooner, but I became ill and then went out of town over XXXX and I am just getting back on the computer and saw these emails from you all. 
Lets start with the address he said I have on file. Perhaps a clerical error however I receive mail from FM at : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, FL XXXX. He states twice that my address is : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX How could this be? But this is what I am dealing with. 
He states my phone number on record is XXXX. I spoke with XXXX # XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX # XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX, XXXX # XXXX ( late in XX/XX/XXXX ) and XXXX XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX and to each of these woman I gave my current phone number which you now have too. There were more CSRs I gave the new phone number to however I dont have them listed as it just became a sad joke to me and XXXX XXXX that they would NOT correct it. If you are willing to do a 3way call with me I would be happy to call their Customer Service Dept. again at XXXX, with you as a witness so you too can see what Im up against. FM states these calls are recorded so there is a trackable record that I have tried to correct this on numerous occasions. Several of these conversations took place at XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, FL XXXX on speaker phone with XXXX XXXX XXXX as a witness and he can verify that I gave them my new phone number several times. XXXX XXXX may be reached at XXXX, or XXXX. I started making my calls to FM having a witness with me because they just blatantly lie. And I have the mentality that everyone is going to believe the huge corporation over me! 
Next, I never gave them the work phone number of XXXX to FM, as that is my exhusbands work phone number and he is unable to take personal phone calls. I have only used that number a handful of times in the XXXX  years we were married, for emergencies. FM took the liberty of putting that phone number on record themselves. And he is now retired so that number is not a good number anymore either. 
Now, as to the comment, Please note that no court has the right to remove a divorced party from an obligation without joining the owner of the debt as a party to a lawsuit such as the divorce lawsuit. I dont understand what he means. XXXX and I are both the owners of the debt and we were both a party to the divorce lawsuit in which the Judge, XXXX and I agreed he would own the home in MI and I would own the condo in FL. I now have the Quit Claim Deed solely in my name for my condo. So, his language sounds like XXXX should be removed from the FM loan and the loan be put in my name solely because we were both joined in a lawsuit as owners of a debt that XXXX was removed from and I shouldnt have to refinance the loan. If for no other reason than common curtesy and for Customer Service, FM should put XXXX XXXX OR XXXX XXXX on all transactions they have with me. 
As to his comment FM sent me a check for {$660.00} and I havent cashed it yet. Lets start with, the check FM sent to  me and dated XX/XX/XXXX was in the amount of {$670.00} not {$660.00}, perhaps another clerical error or just another reason not to trust their math, and it was made out solely to XXXX XXXX and my name was not on the Pay to the Order of line at all ; no and or or was listed anywhere with my name on the Pay to the Order of : line. This is a typical stall tactic of FMs to keep money clients money. And, XXXX XXXX from XXXX XXXX was privy to that conversation with FM on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX with a FM manager by the name of XXXX , on the XXXX XXXX phoneline. The  FM customer service rep/manager stated for me to void the check and not cash it and they would reissue the check within 30 days from the date on the check, which is XX/XX/XXXX. I would have thought 30 days from XX/XX/XXXX when I placed the call but okay getting it reissued before XX/XX/XXXX works for me. I do not remember if the words stop payment were the exact words used, but if you listen to their recorded phone call the FM CSR/manager clearly understood the intent of the call and stated that they, in fact, would reissue the check with my name on the Pay to the Order of line on the check. Whether it would have and or or on the check the CSR didnt know and said there was no one I could talk to at FM to get this clarified/verified. I have NOT received the reissue yet and it is now XX/XX/XXXX. Again, and if for no other reason than common curtesy and for customer service, FM should put XXXX XXXX OR XXXX XXXX on all transactions they have with me. 

Now to the financial part, I am glad he was honest and said he received {$560.00} in escrow when FM bought my loan, as I havent called XXXX XXXX at XXXX XXXX XXXX or XXXX to verify this yet. So thank you XXXX XXXX, for that as it is more than what I have on record so far. 
FM received {$560.00} in escrow from XXXX XXXX when they bought the contract. Which included XX/XX/XXXX escrow. 
So, starting XX/XX/XXXX they received Month Paid Month/Year Total Amount Principal Interest Escrow Late Charge Comments XX/XX/XXXX {$560.00} Transfer from XXXX to FM XX/XX/XXXX {$420.00} {$87.00} {$220.00} {$110.00} No problem ( NP ) XX/XX/XXXX {$420.00} {$88.00} {$220.00} {$110.00} Overcharge ( OC ) of {$.00} XX/XX/XXXX {$420.00} {$88.00} {$220.00} {$110.00} NP XX/XX/XXXX {$420.00} {$88.00} {$220.00} {$110.00} NP XX/XX/XXXX {$420.00} {$89.00} {$220.00} {$110.00} NP XX/XX/XXXX {$420.00} {$89.00} {$220.00} {$110.00} NP XX/XX/XXXX {$420.00} {$89.00} {$220.00} {$110.00} NP XX/XX/XXXX {$420.00} {$90.00} {$220.00} {$110.00} NP XX/XX/XXXX {$420.00} {$90.00} {$220.00} {$110.00} NP XX/XX/XXXX {$420.00} {$90.00} {$220.00} {$110.00} NP XX/XX/XXXX {$420.00} {$91.00} {$220.00} {$110.00} NP XX/XX/XXXX {$420.00} {$91.00} {$220.00} {$110.00} NP XX/XX/XXXX {$420.00} {$91.00} {$220.00} {$110.00} NP XX/XX/XXXX {$420.00} {$92.00} {$220.00} {$110.00} NP XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX {$420.00} {$420.00} {$92.00} {$0.00} {$220.00} {$0.00} {$110.00} {$0.00} NP at first but then OC this is where the BIG PROBLEM BEGINS-the 2nd check they received in XX/XX/XXXX Should have been applied as my XX/XX/XXXX and they just kept it without giving me any credit, this is another {$420.00} I want reimbursed or put into the accounting correctly as my XX/XX/XXXX payment and all my accounting adjusted correctly from here. 
XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX {$420.00} {$230.00} {$2200.00} {$220.00} {$0.00} {$0.00} {$220.00} {$0.00} {$0.00} {$390.00} {$0.00} {$2200.00} {$15.00} OC, This late fee of {$15.00} should be reimbursed as well because they had already received my XX/XX/XXXX payment at the end of XX/XX/XXXX. They intimidated me into making this payment. 
They had the adacity to raise my mtg pymt at this point having taken in {$3800.00} these 2 months. Why did they take so much out in Principle? And they raised my mtg pymt at this point and made me pay an additional {$230.00} to catch up??? I have a 30 year FIXED RATE of {$310.00} a month. As well, they gave me no credit for it in principle or interest, where did this money go? Did it reduce my overall debit if I were to make a pymt in full on my account? 
XX/XX/XXXX {$490.00} {$310.00} {$210.00} {$180.00} {$15.00} OC ; again I have a 30 year FIXED RATE CONTRACT I SIGNED ; INTEREST AND PRINCIPLE SHOULD NEVER EXCEED {$310.00}. They should reimburse this late charge too as they never credited my XX/XX/XXXX payment that I paid them at the end of XX/XX/XXXX. 
XX/XX/XXXX {$510.00} {$110.00} {$210.00} {$180.00} OC, FM charged me {$320.00} in interest and principle. It should NEVER exceed {$310.00}. 
XXXX {$490.00} {$95.00} {$210.00} {$180.00} OC, they never should have raised my mtg pymt.

XX/XX/XXXX {$490.00} {$95.00} {$210.00} {$180.00} OC XX/XX/XXXX {$490.00} {$95.00} {$210.00} {$180.00} OC XX/XX/XXXX {$490.00} {$96.00} {$210.00} {$180.00} OC XX/XX/XXXX {$490.00} {$96.00} {$210.00} {$180.00} OC XX/XX/XXXX {$490.00} {$96.00} {$210.00} {$180.00} OC XX/XX/XXXX {$490.00} {$97.00} {$210.00} {$180.00} OC XX/XX/XXXX {$490.00} {$97.00} {$210.00} {$180.00} OC XX/XX/XXXX {$490.00} {$97.00} {$210.00} {$180.00} OC XX/XX/XXXX So I have paid in {$6900.00} but the overcharges on principle and interest as well as the misapplied XX/XX/XXXX payment and the late charges should be reimbursed also because I have NEVER been late with a payment. {$510.00} {$98.00} {$210.00} {$200.00} OC XX/XX/XXXX {$310.00} $???? $???? {$0.00} NP, EXCEPT THEY STILL HAVE NOT REFUNDED ME ALL MY ESCROW and interest and principle now that I see where the problem started. THEY OVERCHARGED ME! FM still has not given me the amount owed for XX/XX/XXXX. I sent them the 30yr FIXED MTG RATE that I contracted on. 





PAID OUT Month/Year Applied to : Amount XX/XX/XXXX Property Taxes {$1700.00} I did not know FM paid this XX/XX/XXXX Home Owners Ins {$660.00} XXXX Property Taxes {$1400.00} XX/XX/XXXX Home Owners Ins {$660.00} XXXX Property Taxes {$710.00} For a GRAND TOTAL OF {$5200.00} So looking at their books, I have paid into escrow alone {$6900.00} and they have paid out {$5200.00}, leaving in escrow alone {$1700.00}. They raised my mortgage payment and it should never have been raised. They misapplied my XX/XX/XXXX payment in the month of XX/XX/XXXX and its just hanging there in XX/XX/XXXX,  where they applied 2 payments to XX/XX/XXXX and one was for XX/XX/XXXX and the other was for XX/XX/XXXX. So do they go back and do their books correctly or reimburse me the {$420.00}. Thats where all the problems start in their creative accounting and they took all of it in principal and interest. Nothing went to escrow. That all needs to be reimbursed along with the principle and interest. The 2 months that they charged me late payments, those late payments totaling {$31.00}, should be reimbursed because I have never been late. I dont even know how to do the math where they started the misapplication of payments back in XX/XX/XXXX. How do I recoup that with the interest and principal? When they raised my mortgage payment, FM did not give me enough notice in advance to get the payment in timely. Worse, they still havent told me what my payment is for XX/XX/XXXX and its the XXXX of the month now. I went ahead and sent them {$310.00} as that is what the contract states. XX/XX/XXXX was just crazy, FM put {$440.00} into my principal and interest and that is a FIXED 30 yr rate. I should be reimbursed {$130.00} for that overcharge for that month. Where did the {$230.00} go from XX/XX/XXXX ; it just says unapplied. Look at XX/XX/XXXX they took {$530.00} out in principal and interest ; that needs to be reimbursed in the amount of {$220.00}. In the month of XX/XX/XXXX they took {$320.00} in interest and principal ; they need to reimburse me {$16.00} for that month. So I am looking at their books they need to reimburse me at minimum {$2800.00} plus the interest on the money. The amount I came up with on my complaint was from a conversation I had with one of their CSRs that the money they had been putting in escrow was higher than what they showed you an accounting of on this paperwork they sent in. 
ARE MORTGAGE COMPANIES REQUIRED BY LAW TO RETURN OVER PAID MONIES EACH YEAR????? I still have not received the check for this from last year or this year. 
Attached or enclosed, you will find the printout FM sent the BBB in NJ of all payments made and how they said they applied them, or not applied them ; a copy of the NOTE for a 30 year FIXED RATE mortgage at 4.25 % making my payment to them {$310.00} monthly ; the XX/XX/XXXX billing letter showing how the money was being applied ; the letter saying they would let me know how much I owe them for XX/XX/XXXX ; a letter from XX/XX/XXXX stating my escrow has ended ( which is why I am paying them {$310.00} starting XX/XX/XXXX ) ; but I still have not received and a letter showing what they want me to pay ; and the voided check that was never cashed for {$670.00}.

After being assured by a phone call in XXXX and by response to my complaint to the CFPB just a couple weeks ago that the fraudulent forebearance that Navient put my account in would be reversed and my accounts would be set back to the proper repayment plan ; it became apparent today that this did not occur. For more times than I can count Navient has yet again lied about consumer 's repayments. 

My payment is supposed to be {$100.00} set up via autopay on the XXXX of every month with the first payment at this amount being on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. However, only {$37.00} was autodrafted yesterday with 2 of my account suddenly showing that they do not enter repayment until XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. This is FRAUDULENT information again, as they were to enter repayment on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. Navient is attempting to steal money from me by continuing to gain interest they do not deserve. 

When I called tonight I was LIED to by the first customer service rep. I explained the issue that was occurring and all she would say is autopay is set up for XXXX XXXX ... she would n't even read the account. USELESS. Then she claimed there was no one there to help me when I requested a manager saying I would have to wait for a call back in 24 to 48 hours. After threatening to yet again report Navient to the CFPB, suddenly she found a supervisor. Obviously these agents are told to try and put consumers off with lies so Navient can keep collecting interest they have not earned and to keep consumers in the dark on their repayment plans. 

The supervisor refused to help me because apparently by reporting them to the CFPB I now am not able to be serviced by the contact center, only an "" Advocate '' is allowed to speak to me. She can not give me a name or a phone number for these supposed "" Advocates ''. 

So now Navient is retaliating against consumers that report them for their fraudulent operations and refusing to provide any customer service, repayment assistance etc.

However, one day I got an email stating that my payment was late. Confused by the email I called the company and the lady I spoke with assured me that my card had automatic payments. When I asked if the payment would be made and everything would be okay. She again assured me that everything is taken care of. My sole purpose of the call was to make a payment. However, the customer service agent failed to tell me that their system for automatic payments stopped working ... they stopped them altogether. And that my automatic payment would not go through before the time limit in which they would send the missed payment to the bureau. I hung up the phone assured that the payment would be made. I just assumed the system was taking it at the last minute like it usually does. A few weeks go by and I again get an email. This time from XXXX XXXX  telling me that there was a hit on my score.

1/5/2018,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Trouble with how payments are being handled,"For years I have reaching out about how to make payments to my Navient loan ( s ). I learned that payments were only made to select loans and I found myself delinquent in others - even though I was paying the amount assigned monthly. I was constantly trying to get clarification form customer service. Constantly harassed with notices threatening to put my account into delinquency. 
Since XXXX, I was regularly informed that if I could n't make the payment assigned to me that I should apply and renew deferment/forbearance. At times lowered adjustments were offered but still above what I was able to pay- I was made to believe that what I had to offer was not acceptable and I needed to apply for deferment/forbearance in order to not ruin my credit. Unfortunately, in XXXX I was diagnosed with XXXX XXXX and underwent a XXXX XXXX extending the deferment/forbearance status. 
If I had been able to make payments I could afford I could have avoided the accumulation of additional debt and perhaps lowered my monthly payments. 
Today, I called to say that I could start making payments towards my loan and they again said that they could n't accept this payment, instead insisting I pay more than I can afford in my current hardship. Now they are suggesting I pay double of what I can afford and again put 2 loans into deferment/forbearance. I escalated my concerns to 3 different people until a supervisor after much "" calculation '' suggested I apply for a direct loan consolation and a pay as you earn graduate income based repayment. I asked if this was a new option and he said no - it has been around for a few years. I was shocked to know that they had n't counseled me sooner. He said it was almost guaranteed that I would be approved. It 's unbelievable that six years have passed - I am a XXXX XXXX XXXX for children with XXXX and low income communities- and as I dedicated myself to service, I could have been paying towards my balance and working towards forgiveness. I feel robbed of my financial well being. Now I face medical bills that surpass my student loan. I will never climb out of this financial hole. I feel deceived. It is depressing. 
I have renewed my deferment/forbearance for 2 of my loans, paying double of my affordable contribution, awaiting my consolidation application with direct loan.

1/5/2018,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,,Our mortgage payment to LoanDepot was {$1200.00} all of XX/XX/XXXX. We set up an automatic payment of {$1300.00} per month to cover this. When we received our XX/XX/XXXX statement outlining the payment due for XX/XX/XXXX we were shocked to discover that our payment due had jumped to {$1800.00}. We have a fixed rate mortgage that includes escrow and were never advised of this kind of increase being possible. Our first call was made around XX/XX/XXXX. The loan officer that closed this loan would only tell us to call customer service to discuss. Customer service was not able to give us an answer until our sixth call. During one of these calls we were advised that the website we had been going to was not the right one and that they had just changed their site. Then we were told that our taxes had gone up so our escrow was insufficient for the end of year taxes that were due. Our county assessor advised us that our taxes had actually gone down. We decided to pay {$730.00} to avoid any issues and expected to see our regularly scheduled payment of {$1300.00} come out on XX/XX/XXXX. We were again shocked to see that both {$730.00} and {$1800.00} had been drafted by LoanDepot. On XX/XX/XXXX Several e-mails requesting that someone from LoanDepot call us back ( one to each individual listed when we sign in to our account on LoanDepot.com and one to customer service ) were responded to with requests that we call customer service or e-mail a different customer service e-mail address. One even said that they do n't draft payments!!! We did not want to call customer service because that was how we ended up in this situation in the first place. We did not receive a phone call from anyone so we called. It took 15 minutes to get a live person on the phone. On this call the representative made a similar claim about our taxes going up. When asked whether this kind of increase seemed normal she only said that it could happen. When asked for details about our previous conversation with customer service the agent claimed the calls were recorded but claimed she did n't see any notes about that conversation. We asked that they review that recording to find out if their representative had advised us that the automatic payment would be {$1800.00}. We did not agree to our automatic payment increasing beyond {$1300.00}. The customer service representative claimed that the payment would match the statement and that this was in the documentation about the automatic payment. We asked to talk with someone that was involved in analyzing our taxes and adjusting our escrow and were told that they do not take phone calls but we could e-mail yet another customer service department. This e-mail was met with an automated response on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX that said our question had been received and we should expect a response within 24 hours. It has been well over 24 hours as of the writing of this complaint and we have not received any further communication from LoanDepot.,Company believes complaint is the result of an isolated error,"loanDepot.com, LLC",MO,63376,,Consent provided,Web,1/5/2018,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,N/A,2773026

They let me know that there was nothing that they could do to help me lower my payments and that the only option was to pay or use up more forbearance. I had 7 months of forbearance left. My goal was to not use forbearance unless my family stumbled across hard times in which it would truly be needed ; instead I wanted to make payments to Navient in an affordable amount. 

Since telling me that I am unable to lower and make those payments, I am now using 3 of those 7 months of forbearance and I am set to start back making payments on XX/XX/XXXX.
